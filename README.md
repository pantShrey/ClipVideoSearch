# Clip_SearchAPI
Allows you to search videos with frames similar to the query you put .

General Pipline is as follows:

Download video from dataset.csv->extract frames->encode them->index them->query them->reconstruct video path from the results







ps: Can't Convert it into API as the video are stored in my google drive but my google cloud console is not allowing api calls to it also making api in colab is difficult
