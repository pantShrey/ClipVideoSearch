"Paddleboarding on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii",/watch?v=BlaOCzzqZb4,Food,"Go to http://migrationology.com/ for more travel and street food videos!

In this video I head to the North Shore of Oahu in Hawaii to have my first try at stand up paddleboarding!

It's not quite as easy as it may looks, but I can tell you that it's a lot of fun.

A paddle board is kind of a cross between an actual surf board and a wind surf board. The board is larger and wide and there's a foam of grip covering the entire thing.

Instead of really riding waves, while paddleboarding you have a boat paddle and stand on the board while paddling.

The hardest part about it is getting your balance corrects according to the oncoming ripples of the waves of the ocean.

Next time you're at the ocean, be sure to try riding on a stand up paddle board!

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let‚Äôs enjoy right here, where we at

Who knows where this road is supposed to lead
We got nothin‚Äô but time
As long as you right here next time
Everything‚Äôs gonna be alright

[Chorus]
If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby just let it be
If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby just let it be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby if it‚Äôs meant to be

[Verse 2]
I don‚Äôt need to be so uptight
But my heart‚Äôs been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn‚Äôt treat me right
I ain‚Äôt gonna lie, I ain‚Äôt gonna lie

‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm tired of the fake love
Show me what you‚Äôre made of
Boy, make me believe

[Florida Georgia Line]
Whoa hold up, girl, don‚Äôt you know you‚Äôre beautiful
And it‚Äôs easy to see

[Chorus]
If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby just let it be
If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby just let it be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby if it‚Äôs meant to be

So come on ride with me, ride with me,
See where this thing goes
So come on ride with me, ride with me,
Maybe if it‚Äôs meant to be

[Bridge]
Maybe we do, maybe we don‚Äôt
Maybe we will, maybe we won‚Äôt

[Chorus]
But if it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby just let it be
If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby just let it be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby if it‚Äôs meant to be

If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby if it‚Äôs meant to be
If it‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be, it‚Äôll be
Baby if it‚Äôs meant to be

The Boxer Rebellion l HISTORY OF CHINA,/watch?v=0l4C3vZudZI,History,"The Boxer Rebellion was one of China's biggest uprisings against the unwanted European, US-American and Japanese Imperialism. Distrust and tensions marked all contacts with foreigners. Secret societies were formed to propagate against the enemy. The Yihequan, also known as Boxers, quickly rose to one of the biggest organisations in Northern China. Masters of close combat, they mainly targeted converted Chinese Christians and attacks increased wildly in the 1880s. From 1900 Empress Dowager Cixi was less and less opposed to the Rebellion, as she hoped to fight back foreign influence. Shortly after, even the Chinese Army started helping the rebels and foreigners were fought, killed or driven out. Consequently, an alliance of the imperial powers sent in 50.000 soldiers to end the massacre. Tough reprisals and treaties followed. Learn all about the Boxer Rebellion on IT'S HISTORY.

This Theory Suggests Our Perspective of Galaxies Could Be Wrong,/watch?v=E1HtIf2ZVR8,Science&Technology,"Our perspective from Earth could be distorting our understanding of space. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the theory of AGN unification.

Why It‚Äôs Hard to Recognize a Black Hole
http://nautil.us/blog/why-its-hard-to-recognize-a-black-hole
‚ÄúIf they are all fueled by supermassive black holes, why don‚Äôt all AGN look the same? One reason could be our point of view. The theory of AGN unification posits that all AGN have the same basic building blocks (accretion disk, jets, torus); The striking differences we observe, according to this theory, are all due to their orientation in space.‚Äù

Active Galaxies
https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/active_galaxies1.html
‚ÄúActive galaxies are galaxies that have a small core of emission embedded at the center of an otherwise typical galaxy. This core is typically highly variable and very bright compared to the rest of the galaxy.‚Äù

What are active galactic nuclei?
https://phys.org/news/2016-11-galactic-nuclei.html
‚ÄúIn the 1970s, astronomers became aware of a compact radio source at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy ‚Äì which they named Sagittarius A. After many decades of observation and mounting evidence, it was theorized that the source of these radio emissions was in fact a supermassive black hole (SMBH).‚Äù

How is Europe manufacturing the ITER Toroidal Field coils?,/watch?v=AaRW50ZSqmk,manufacturing,"The ITER burning plasma is expected to reach 150 million ¬∞C. How are we going to confine it?
18 powerful superconducting magnets, known as Toroidal Field coils, will be powered with 68 000 A to generate a magnetic field of 11.8 Tesla (approximately 1 million times stronger the magnetic fields of the Earth!). In this ‚Äúcage‚Äù we will entrap the energy of a small sun.

"Giethoorn, Venice of The North - Travel Vlog (Video Blog) Travel Netherlands üá≥üá±",/watch?v=wqNCvQMv8oo,travel blog,"This is our guide to Giethoorn, Netherlands and what you may expect there.

We vlogged (video blogged) our day trip to Giethoorn, also widely regarded as Venice of The Netherlands or Venice of the North. We rented boats and toured the canals of the city.

Giethoorn is charming with many channels and boats. Many tourists come here to relax and go to the nearby national park.

About a year ago Chinese tourists discovered Giethoorn. They come by tourist buses or local buses. The whole city is getting adjusted to the Chinese tourists, they are learning Chinese, have Chinese written menus and signs, and even the bus tickets for the public transport buses are now written in Chinese. But not only does Chinese tourists come here, Indians, Americans, Thai and other tourists started to discover Giethoorn too.

In this video we spend a day in Jaipur city visiting the maharajas gardens and monkey temple. Then we head to Jodhpur city to our next great hotel!

In this vlog, the reality of working conditions and pay really hit me and I see why 'made in India' is becoming increasingly affordable for business'. We also visit the most fantastic monkey temple which felt like we had stepped into The Jungle Book! We have some roof top dinner. The next day we head to the Prince Albert Museum in Jaipur. After 6 hours in the car we make it to Jodhpur, I'm feeling a little low. #jaipurindia #indiatravelvlog #jodhpur #travelvlog #indiatravelguide

What does it feel like to be present? To be here in the now and fully experiencing this moment. Free from any weight of the past or any anticipation of the future. Just free. Free to realize that only you can control how you feel. About anything. Free to see things for what they are and free to give your time and energy to what really matters.
Accept the fact that everything that makes up your world is there because you attracted it with your own thoughts. Realize that you can control your thoughts and emotions. There‚Äôs no big secret. Just choose to think better feeling thoughts. Listen to your emotions and chose to feel good. You can decide to be in a place of attraction and abundance.
What do you want to do in your life? What makes you tick? What makes you feel awe? Don‚Äôt be misled into thinking that you‚Äôre supposed to do anything. You are supposed to do only what you chose to do.  The world is vast and full of possibilities. Follow your bliss. Get out of your comfort zone. Stop looking for reasons why you can‚Äôt and look for reasons why you can.

"Nepali Street Food - DEEP FRIED Snacks in Kathmandu, Nepal!",/watch?v=pf493MCi5rA,Food,"Nepali street food snacks in Kathmandu, Nepal!
‚ñ∫Subscribe to my channel for more videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

After traveling through India, we took a flight from Delhi to Kathmandu. I was excited to explore a bit of Nepal, and we first began our explorations in the largest city of Kathmandu. Kathmandu is a beautiful city and there are quite a few things to do. But as a foodie traveler, I was of course most interested in sampling Nepali food and also Nepali street food, which I knew very little about before visiting Nepal.

In Kathmandu, there's not a lot of street food when you compare the city to a place like Bangkok. There are some stalls, but many of the street food is housed in small tiny little restaurants where you pull back a curtain and sit on small tables and benches to enjoy home cooked noodles and momo dumplings. Around the Boudha stupa (also known as Boudhanath stupa) in Kathmandu, there are some good Nepali street food carts, many of them serving a mixture of both Tibetan and Nepali street food snacks.

When I saw this cart that was cooking something extremely delicious smelling along with a pair of very friendly vendors, I knew I'd have to give it a sample. The vendors were very happy to be featured and I quickly ordered two items from their menu. All their street food were stacked within the glass encased cart and as soon as someone would order something, they would quickly dunk it into the hot oil until hot through and through. The vendors would then put them on top of a piece of newspaper, and slice them into pieces. Depending on your personal preference, the vendor would then scoop on a spoon of hot sauce to add extra flavor and complete the Nepali street food snack.

I started by street food sampling with a buffalo shapale, which is a Tibetan Nepali meat pie. It was filled with minced buffalo and possibly some onions. The flavor was great from the meat and it was improved by the hot and salty chili sauce. Next up was something known as an aloo chop, which is basically a deep fried potato cutlet. It was incredibly good, a ball of spicy mashed potatoes that were crispy on the outside and flavored so wonderfully. For my final Nepali street food snack this round, I couldn't resist a small piece of Nepal style fried chicken. The meat on the little drumstick was pushed all the way to the end so it provided a chicken handle with which is hold while enjoying the chicken. The chicken was pretty delicious, a proper street food snack. Thanks for watching this Nepali street food video and hope you can enjoy these snacks when you visit Kathmandu!

2.) Hinduism - 10 Avatars of Vishnu and Darwin's Theory of Evolution - Parallels. https://youtu.be/L0X4dM1ve4g

1. ORIGINS:
#Hinduism is the worlds oldest known religion. History of Hinduism can be traced back to 5,000-7,000 B.C.
#Hinduism originated around the Indus Valley near the River Indus (INDIA).
#Hindu is derived from the Sanskrit word Sindhu used by the ‚ÄòAryans‚Äô. The word Hindu or Indu was used by Greeks and Persians to denote the country and people living beyond the Indus river.
#Unlike most other religions, Hinduism has no single founder, no single scripture, and no single governing body.

2. BELIEFS:
#Hinduism is known as 'a way of life' or 'a family of religions' rather than a single religion. It is referred as the SanƒÅtana Dharma, ""the eternal law"" or the ""eternal way‚Äù beyond human origins.
#Hindus believe that existence is a cycle of birth (samsara), death, and rebirth, governed by Karma.
#All living creatures have a soul ‚Äì the spirit or true ""self"" of every person, called the ƒÅtman. The soul is believed to be eternal.
#The goal of life in Hinduism is to attain¬†salvation, or MOKSHA..

3. OBJECTIVES OF LIFE (Puru·π£ƒÅrtha)
#DHARMA (righteousness, ethics) - The foremost goal in Hinduism. Dharma makes life and universe possible and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and ""right way of living‚Äù.
#ARTHA (livelihood, wealth) - Objective and virtuous pursuit of wealth for livelihood, obligations and economic prosperity.
#KƒÅma (Desire, Sensual Pleasure) - Desire, wish, passion, longing, pleasure of the senses, the aesthetic enjoyment of life, affection, or love, with or without sexual connotations.
#Mok·π£a (liberation, freedom from samsara) - The ultimate goal in Hinduism. Moksha is associated with liberation from sorrow, suffering and sa·πÉsƒÅra (birth-rebirth cycle).

4. SACRED TEXTS
#All the books related to Hinduism are written in one common language, Sanskrit - the oldest known language in the world.
#Vedas, form the earliest record of the Hindu scriptures', and are regarded as eternal truths revealed to the ancient sages.
#The Upanishads are the foundation of Hindu philosophical thought, and have profoundly influenced diverse traditions.
#The epics consist of the Mahabharata (10 times larger than Iliad and Odyssey combined together) and the Ramayana.
#TheBhagavad Gita  (part of the Mahabharata) is one of the most popular sacred texts of Hinduism.

5. GODS & GODDESSES
#Hinduism has many gods and goddesses, all manifestations of the Supreme Being ‚Äì Brahman. Depending upon belief the Brahman can be one of the ‚Ä¶...
#BRAHMA - The creator of all Universe.
#VISHNU - The Preserver or Protector of the Universe.
#SHIVA - The Destroyer of the Universe.

6. HOLIEST‚Ä¶
#Place - Varanasi (Kashi) - The oldest city of India and also considered as the most holy of the places.
#Symbol ‚Äì OM - The sound heard at the time of creation of the universe.
#Animal ‚Äì COW - Symbol of the Earth. It always gives and feeds, representing life and the support of life.
#River ‚Äì GANGES - Bathing in the river causes the remission of sins and facilitates Moksha (liberation from the cycle of life and death).

7. INTERESTING FACTS
#‚ÄòKumbhamela‚Äô, a Hindu Festival is the largest gathering of humans in the world.
#Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism originated from Hinduism, all these religions share lots of common philosophies.
#The largest Hindu temple in the world is surprisingly not in India but is in Angkor Wat, Cambodia.
#The holiest number in Hinduism is 108. Most of the prayer beads have 108 beads. 108 is the ratio of Sun‚Äôs distance from Earth to Sun‚Äôs diameter or Moon‚Äôs distance from Earth to Moon‚Äôs diameter.
#Yoga, the World‚Äôs most practiced form of spiritual and physical fitness procedure, originated from Hinduism in the Indus - Saraswati civilization 5000 years ago.

8. HINDUISM TODAY
#Hinduism has over 1.1 Billion followers today which is over 15% of the world population.
#Nepal, India and Mauritius have majority Hindu population.
#Majority Hindus live in South East Asia.

euronews hi-tech - Painting for change,/watch?v=xv4zlvwShyw,Art&Music,"http://www.euronews.com/ Scientists in the UK have been developing specially 'conductive' paints to be printed onto building materials, where they can then generate their own electricity from the sunlight they absorb.

If the project proves successful, it could mean that houses and offices built in the future will contribute to general energy supplies. 

Researchers in Baglan, Wales, are using screen presses and roller coating techniques to cover building materials with the specially designed solar paints.

Customised chemical compounds are added in layers to sheets of glass, plastic and steel, which then absorb the power of the sun.

Senior Technology Transfer Fellow, Eifion Jewell, notes there are several distinct chemical compounds capable of making the difference:

""In its simplest form we can use carbon graphite - the type of thing you get in a pencil, because you can get a pencil to conduct electricity. But we might be putting other things such as silvers... so we can make an ink which is silver and when we dry it it's conductive.""

By cladding buildings in these paints, researchers hope to revolutionise the renewable energy market.

Not only do they think they will create thousands of new jobs in the sector but that these paints will transform the way we see our cities, as everyday buildings - schools, supermarkets, churches - all become power stations in their own right.

What The World's Healthiest Diets Have In Common
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/healthiest-diets-world_us_57cc716fe4b0a22de0966ff2
""To research his 2010 book The 5 Factor World Diet, celebrity trainer and nutritionist Harley Pasternak traveled to the healthiest countries around the world to learn more about what made their meals extra nourishing. He noted that Japanese people eat a wonderful variety of seaweeds, and that Chinese people tried to incorporate at least five different colors in every meal. But Pasternak also came away with some valuable observations about how different the North American way of life was compared to many other countries.""

Why are Mediterranean diets so healthy?
https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/why-are-mediterranean-diets-so-healthy
""There has been a lot of talk recently about whether fat or sugar is the worst offender when it comes to our diets. But by focusing on individual dietary components it's easy to miss the bigger picture. While it's important to understand how different foods and nutrients affect our health, a whole diet approach offers a more helpful way of looking at our eating habits and choices.""

Greek Orthodox fasting rituals: a hidden characteristic of the Mediterranean diet of Crete.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15333159
""The longevity and excellent health status of the population of Crete has been attributed to its lifestyle and dietary habits. The impact of Greek Orthodox Christian Church fasting on these dietary habits has never been studied. One hundred and twenty Greek Orthodox Christians living in Crete participated in a 1-year prospective study.""

First Observation Of Antimatter Wave Interference
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08901.pdf
‚ÄúThe periodic spatial distribution generated by the interferometer (Fig. 1) is revealed by a nuclear
emulsion detector. Nuclear emulsions14 offer submicron level position resolution in the detection of
ionizing particles9,15. They work as photographic films by exploiting the properties of silver-bromide
crystals embedded in a 50 Œºm thick gelatin matrix. For this experiment we developed a glass-supported emulsion detector and experimentally demonstrated its capability to resolve periodic patterns at the micrometric scale even with low signal contrast and on large areas‚Äù

This Classic Physics Experiment Could Finally Reveal The Long-Awaited 'Theory of Everything'
https://www.sciencealert.com/this-classic-physics-experiment-could-finally-reveal-the-long-awaited-theory-of-everything
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not so strange though - we know that matter (ping-pong balls) doesn‚Äôt behave in the same way as waves. But when physicists fired particles like electrons and photons at the double slit, expecting them to act like matter, they instead acted like waves, producing an interference pattern. And it gets even crazier than that. These electrons and photons aren‚Äôt acting like matter, but they aren‚Äôt acting like waves either, because they‚Äôre not messing with each other to produce an interference pattern.‚Äù

Antimatter mysteries 2: How do you make antimatter?

‚ÄúTwo CERN experiments, ATRAP and ALPHA, are grappling with that question. Their aim is to make antihydrogen ‚Äì the simplest anti-atom possible, just an antiproton and a positron bound together ‚Äì in sufficient quantity and for long enough to compare the spectrum of light it emits with that of regular hydrogen. Even the slightest difference between the two would shake up the standard model.‚Äù

"Delicious Indian Street Food Round Roti (Baati Chokha) on a Backlane in Varanasi, India",/watch?v=7WjU3U939L8,Food,"Indian round roti, known as baati chokha, are a popular street food to eat in Varanasi and other parts of North India.

What exactly is a baati chokha? Well to be honest with you, when I stopped by this street food vendor I had absolutely no idea what they were - and that's exactly the reason why I felt compelled to stop and try some. Though the vendor's mouth was packed full of paan mouth chew, I could make out him telling me that they were round rotis. So imagine a roti, which is similar to a tortilla, or just a blob of dough, rounded up into a small ball about the size of a golf ball and grilled. Within the ball were a mix of spices called garam masala. And if that doesn't already sound tasty enough, it was served with an outstanding green chili sauce, a slice of green chili, and a wedge of red onion.

To eat a baati chokha (round roti), you simply tell the vendor how many of the little guys you want and he will place them right off the grill onto your plate. From there he added a scoop of unknown sauce which happened to be delicious, and the extra few condiments. I was actually surprised at just how good these little roti balls were - partly it was the garam masala sauce and partly it was the delicious sauce. Anyway, I really enjoyed these baati chokha's so much that I ended up eating a few of them, amazed at the flavors from such a simple filling treat.

This little Indian street food vendor in Varanasi is located right along the main burning ghat funeral lane. Though I didn't know at first, as soon as I ordered and started to eat, a funeral procession came marching down the lane as I ate. It was quite an exciting and unique street food snack to be eating while funerals marched past every few minutes.

If you visit North India, you should by all means try to sample some round roti baati chokha. They are filling and delicious, and I think they make a fabulous snack or even would be a wonderful breakfast.

Strange Interactive Art Installation of Musical Instrument Inventions - Music Box Roving Village,/watch?v=v-toMaehfmQ,Art&Music,"When the Music Box Roving Village  is installed in a new location they change and add new instruments so when you see it it won't look the same or have the same instruments as you see in this documentary -  This documentary exhibits strange musical instruments invented by the New Orleans Airlift collaboration.  It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.

Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.
New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.

Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.

Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.

New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.

 Special Head Levitation
He is  best known for his appearances on America‚Äôs Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!

""The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me, That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton
""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. 

The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.

The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer - Canada Museum of Science and Technology,/watch?v=LHtseplPqO4,Science&Technology,"Hugh LeCaine of Ottawa created the Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer in his home studio over a period of three years from 1945 to 1948. This synthesizer is the first voltage-controlled synthesizer ever built, preceding the manufacture of commercial synthesizers by twenty years. Le Caine, a nuclear physicist with the National Research Council, was passionate about music. He was concerned that the musical notes produced by electronic instruments in the 1930s, such as the Hammond Organ and the Morse Robb Wave Organs, lacked a certain expressivity. Determined to shape technology for the needs of the musician and expand the possibilities of musical sound he built a synthesizer that allows for complex variations in pitch and tone. This, LeCaine achieved, through the innovative use of voltage control. The technique provides an automatic background voltage that can remain stable or be altered through the manipulation of the knobs and keyboard. The keys are sensitive to a vertical pressure that controls the volume and a lateral pressure that changes the pitch. In this way the musician can simultaneously manipulate the volume, pitch, and timbre of each note and produce gradual transitions from one sound to the next. The rudimentary appearance of the synthesizer  its three legs made of crossed pieces of scrap wood and with instructions penciled onto its surface  camouflages the brilliant concept behind this invention. LeCaine's Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer is the precursor of today's electronic instruments."

Sidebar: The Holographic Principle
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sidebar-the-holographic-p/
‚ÄúThe idea comes from black hole physics. In the 1970s researchers knew that when an object becomes part of a black hole, two things happen. One, all the detailed information about that object is lost. And two, the surface area of the black hole's event horizon (the point of no return for infalling matter and energy) grows.‚Äù

‚ÄúA unique experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory has started collecting data that will answer some mind-bending questions about our universe‚Äîincluding whether we live in a hologram.‚Äù

Study reveals substantial evidence of holographic universe
https://phys.org/news/2017-01-reveals-substantial-evidence-holographic-universe.html
A holographic universe, an idea first suggested in the 1990s, is one where all the information that makes up our 3-D 'reality' (plus time) is contained in a 2-D surface on its boundaries.

Angular-momentum nanometrology in an ultrathin plasmonic topological insulator film
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06952-1
‚ÄúComplementary metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (CMOS) technology has provided a highly sensitive detection platform for high-resolution optical imaging, sensing and metrology. Although the detection of optical beams carrying angular momentum have been explored with nanophotonic methods, the metrology of optical angular momentum has been limited to bulk optics. We demonstrate angular-momentum nanometrology through the spatial displacement engineering of plasmonic angular momentum modes in a CMOS-compatible plasmonic topological insulator material.‚Äù

The concept of orbital angular momentum (OAM) has done nothing less than inspire a reimagining of what we‚Äôre capable of doing with electromagnetic radiation. Beams that carry OAM can be used to move tiny objects, and they have been used to enhance the resolving power of microscopes.‚Äù

What is the internet? 13 key questions answered

‚ÄúOne measure is the amount of information that courses through it: about five exabytes a day. That‚Äôs equivalent to 40,000 two-hour standard definition movies per second.It takes some wiring up. Hundreds of thousands of miles of cables criss-cross countries, and more are laid along sea floors to connect islands and continents. About 300 submarine cables, the deep-sea variant only as thick as a garden hose, underpin the modern internet. Most are bundles of hair-thin fibre optics that carry data at the speed of light.‚Äù

Top Ten Weird Foods of India,/watch?v=mMXYCsrQNkY,Food,"1. CHAPDA CHINTI CHUTNEY
The sight of a column of soldier ants can frighten anyone, but for the tribes of Chhattisgarh, these ants indicate a good meal.
Chapda chinti ki chutney is a dish made of red ants (Curcuma angustifolia) mashed with salt, red chilies and mustard oil. It is usually eaten with stale rice. The tribal elders believe red ants have medicinal properties that can cure common ailments like coughs, colds, stomach infections and strengthen their immune system.

2. SNAILS
The sight of soft, slippery molluscs might be gross for many but for some communities of North-Eastern India, snails are a treat, but the process to prepare them is long. The snails first have to be kept in salt water for at least two to three days. This is to clear the undesirable contents in their digestive system. Then follows thorough washing and cutting, which of course takes hours. Then again, soaking them in salted or plain water for some more hours before one can start the final cooking. The actual cooking is in itself a long, tedious process. Is all that hard work worthwhile??? Definitely! One gets to enjoy a hot steaming snail dish filled with aromatic local spices and herbs.

3. BEE LARVAE
Bees stir fried with bamboo shoots and soya beans, both fermented and served with a hot steaming plate of rice is a favourite meal in parts of North-East India. They say the dish tastes like meat but more interesting is the price of the bees. A handful or a bit more of fresh bee larvae can cost up to 1000 Indian rupees or close to US$ 15.

4. FERMENTED FISH
Ngari (Manipur), Shidal/Seedal (Assam, Tripura), Tungtap (Meghalaya) are different types of fermented fish. It is highly popular in the North-Eastern states of India. Small fresh water fish are tightly packed in big clay urns and left to ferment for many months. The final product is sticky fish with a strong, pungent smell.

5. FERMENTED BAMBOO SHOOT
Baas tenga (Nagaland),Soibum, Soidon, Soidon (Manipur) are different types of fermented bamboo shoot relished by people of some parts of North-East India.
WARNING!! Fermented bamboo shoot preparations are notable for their putrid smell.

6. FERMENTED SOYA BEAN
Hawaizar or Akhuni is soybean boiled over low heat and kept airtight for three to five days. It is normally eaten as chutney mixed with fiery chilies, salt garnished with coriander and local herbs.
The Manipuris make a special dish called chagempomba where the soybean is cooked with broken rice, seasonal leafy vegetables, aromatic herbs and fish.
TRY IT IF YOU HAVE A ‚ÄòNOT TOO SENSITIVE‚Äô NOSE.

7. SILKWORMS
Eaten stir-fried or boiled with red chillies and baas tenga or akhuni, silkworms can be found aplenty in the markets of Nagaland. There one can find two varieties of silkworms and a kilo of each cost around 350-400 Indian Rupees a kilo or US$ 4-5.

8. FROGS
Another unusual dish of Nagaland is frog meat cooked with baas tenga or akhuni. Not everyone there eats frogs but those who eat say, ‚Äòfrog meat is as tasty and juicy as chicken‚Äô.
You can try it for a change though.

9. ROASTED RATS
An unusual evening snack from Ziro Valley, Arunachal Pradesh is roasted rat. After removing the innards of the rats, they are put on skewers to be cooked over a fire.  After a thorough roast, they are ready to eat! The men of the valley first poke around to find out where the rats live, set up small fires to smoke them out of their underground tunnel networks, and catch them upon exit.
Some are quite fast, so quick hands are a necessity.

10. DRIED PORK WITH MAGGOTS
Dried in the sun for years and even decades, this vintage pork meat with maggots crawling is a tasty delight in Ziro Valley of Arunachal Pradesh. The villagers savour the maggots or just ignore them! Some remove them before eating‚Ä¶ ONLY SOME!!!
This vintage pork is also a valuable gift item.

"Science, Technology, & Society Program: A 21st Century Perspective",/watch?v=XniKEtFVZco,Science&Technology,"The presentation is based upon a recent literature review that intends to highlight some of the critical research that has been synthesized on the perspectives of both teachers and students and their attitudes to teaching and learning in an STS-themed learning environment. The first portion of the presentation draws on the perspectives of elementary and secondary school teachers both locally and abroad. The information collected is intended to illustrate some of the major successes, as well as barriers to implementation in several different classrooms. While much of the research has been focused on the need for additional remedial training for teachers and the use of assessment, the presentation will present data focusing on the overall attitude and educational successes of students that participate in an STS-enriched learning environment. By examining the current research on STS, it is expected that a clear picture will be created demonstrating the place of STS in the overall science curriculum. The conclusion of the presentation will also aim to indicate disparities still present in the growing body of STS research and areas of future focus.

We are at the last part of the Sermon on the Mount.  Yahshua addresses a lot of things that needs to be understood.  He teaches us how to pray, how to do good, He teaches us about money, tells us not to worry, speaks about judging, asking and receiving, entering by the narrow gate, and He prophesies about many in judgment won't be accepted, as well as more topics.  These are all important topics.  If you watch apply these teachings, you will be closer to Him.  I hope it blesses you!

Technology vs Modern Science,/watch?v=Y6zDhH160Wg,Science&Technology,"Go to UniversalModel.com to learn more.

From Volume I of  Universal Model, A New Millennial Science, on page 57 we find the following difference between Science and Technology:

""Scientific leaders recognize the difficulty in getting the public excited over natural science but they also understand the importance of gaining their support. Popularity drives the funding for new research, a multi-billion dollar proposition in America today. How do you convince the public to fund unpopular theoretical research? Over the past several decades, there has been a growing trend to group science and technology into the generic category of ‚Äòscience.‚Äô This largely successful effort has effectively blurred the line between them and few people recognize their important differences. One difference remains significant‚Äîscience has not enjoyed the success that technology has.
We recognize one example in the bestselling American science magazine, Scientific American. During the last two decades, it has become increasingly difficult for science journals and magazines to fill their pages with purely scientific discoveries and stories to maintain readership. On the other hand, technological journals and magazines have grown exponentially, graced with abundant technological discoveries and stories. Scientific American recognized this, and several years ago, the magazine announced to its readers it was changing its format to include new sections dedicated to technology.

""In one instance, they presented twenty World Changing Ideas in the December 2009 issue, to ‚Äúbuild a cleaner, healthier, smarter world‚Äù (page 50). Of the twenty ideas, only three were science-based. The remaining seventeen were technology-based. This ratio of 3/20 science-based ideas is probably typical of the science-verses-technology circumstance that exists today. There are many more successful technological inventions than there are new scientific discoveries. Most new scientific discoveries (such as those in astronomy and biology) are often a direct result of technological advances in telescopes, DNA testing, and other equipment and procedures. Often times, these new techno-related discoveries contradict existing theories, a topic we approach in later chapters.  In another text, the ‚Äúpower of science‚Äù is mingled with ‚Äútechnologies‚Äù:

‚ÄúThe power of science cannot be denied: it has given us computers and jets, vaccines and thermonuclear bombs, technologies that, for better or worse, have altered the course of history.‚Äù  End of Science, John Horgan, P.4, 1996

""Computers, jets, and bombs are NOT science, but are technological inventions. We can find examples like this, where science and technology incorrectly mingle outcomes in almost every science related book, magazine, or newspaper.""

I had fish head curry in Singapore and it was pretty good but the fish head curry here in Jakarta was the BEST I've EVER HAD!

The fish was the most tender and succulent and the curry was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. Also the lobster and pepper crab I had ranks among some of the best seafood I've ever devoured. The place was pricier than most other restaurants in Jakarta but the seafood was DELICIOUS.

Tenmu Becomes a God | History of Japan 24,/watch?v=KGyMyU81a0U,History,"How does Emperor Tenmu make himself a god?

IMPORTANT: I may have focused too much on the propaganda aspect of the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki (and there is indeed plenty of propaganda), but I don't want to leave the impression that the texts were wholly invented. Many of the historical events are considered fairly reliable, and much of the myths were written down from oral tradition rather than invented out of thin air.

Secret History of the Freemasons ~ Full Documentary,/watch?v=OlwsJWkgu7k,History,"The first president of the United States, George Washington, was a Mason, along with 13 other presidents and numerous Supreme Court Justices. Benjamin Franklin published a book about Freemasonry on his own printing press. Nine signers of the Declaration of Independence were Freemasons, including the man with the biggest signature: Jon Hancock...

Suspected throughout their long history of plotting to overtake the world accused of fomenting revolution and reviled as devil worshippers that stole King Solomon's treasure the Freemasons claim they're merely a civic-minded fraternity bound together by harmless rituals. Our high-energy cocktail of dramatic reenactment expert interviews and on-location footage entertains historians Akram Elias Stephen Bullock and Brent Morris to retell the Freemasons' central myth concerning Hiram Abiff mythical builder of Jerusalem's Temple of Solomon. During construction he was killed by three workers who believed his ""secret"" would impart magical powers--representing the three evils against which Freemasons believe they're still struggling: ignorance fanaticism and tyranny. Today the world's 2.5 million Freemasons meet to reenact the ritual of Hiram's murder as the initiation ceremony for the main rank of Master Mason.AMERICA: Is America the creation of the Freemasons? For hundreds of years suspicions of a plot to take over America have swirled around the Freemasons the world's oldest secret society. Freemasons led the Revolution framed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution designed our nation's capitaland in the early years of the Republic grew to unmatched heights of influence and power. The untold story of the Freemasons in America reveals secret codes patterns in the sky murder and a radically new picture of the nation's Founding Fathers."

We have all heard of the rags to riches stories from entrepreneurs who went bankrupt (Walt Disney, Donald Trump), were fired from their first companies (Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey), lost all of their investors' money (Henry Ford), or blew up their first company (Bill Gates, Paul Allen). And then later, of course, they succeeded. Rightly, failure has become a topic de jour as a result, and many individuals consider failure to be a badge of honor.""

In this video, I have reviewed Food Science by Norman Potter - 5th edition.

Amazon link for Objective Food Science by S. K. Sharma -https://amzn.to/2Nxe6KL

Best part about this book - It covers most of the basic concepts of food science and technology.

There‚Äôs a famous quote from a man ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you are an expert in your field, you won‚Äôt have to run after opportunities, rather the opportunities will come running after you‚Äù.

Now if you want to be an expert in food science or food technology, you‚Äôll have to take small steps every day. And this book by Norman Potter will provide you a strong foundation to build the basic concepts of food science and technology.

Now, food science by Norman Potter is the one of the best books for any student who‚Äôs pursuing a major/degree in food science/technology.
The authors of this book ‚Äì N. Potter & Joseph Hotchkiss have been Professors in the Department of Food Science at the Cornell University, in New York.
Cornell University has one of the oldest departments of food science in the world and this university ranks amongst top 20 universities all over the world.

So, this book has a pretty solid background.

This book is not only going to be helpful for you in the first/second year, but this book is also going to provide you some reference & some insight even in your whole graduation even in your post-graduation.

I refer to this book even now.

There are 25 chapters and the book is about 600 pages.
Price ranges from 450-490 [Usually stays below 500].

Most of the faculties and most of the professors refer to this textbook because of its versatility and coverage of the basic concepts as well.

And this is why I highly recommend for you to study, to read this book, to understand the concepts of this book.
To build a strong foundation of Food Science and technology so that you can build an expertise in the food industry and in the academics of your college.

Snapchat Travel Blogger takeover in New Orleans - TripIt,/watch?v=a_4Is-A8ccw,travel blog,"Travel, video and food blogger Cailin O'Neil of TravelYourself.ca does a Snapchat takeover for TripIt in New Orleans, Louisiana. Come explore the streets and shops of the city, learn about the famous King Cake, take a food tour and enjoy a drink or two on Bourbon street.

Please remember when viewing that this media was meant for SnapChat where after images are viewed you can tap them to move on to the next. For this reason some still images may last longer than a still image in a typical youtube video. Because of that the video flow and speed might be a bit longer than your typical youtube video and may seem slow. Please keep this in mind.

"Chow Kit Market in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysa",/watch?v=-B9Pup4maRk,Food,"Be sure to head over to http://migrationology.com/ for lots more travel and street food videos!

Kuala Lumpur is a fascinating city in Southeast Asia. It's a diverse city that has so many different dimensions and so many different layers. The downtown area is home to massively tall skyscrapers like the KL Tower and the twin Petronas Towers. However, there are still some areas that seem ancient, areas that have remained similar for many years despite the rapid construction and development surrounding them.

Chow Kit Market, the largest wet fresh market in Kuala Lumpur is where the ingredients of Malaysian cuisine come alive. The sprawling market is located in the Chow Kit area of town and includes just about every fresh ingredient you could ever imaging for cooking Malay, Indian, or Chinese cuisine. Though the market is outdoors and looks a little makeshift, it's actually quite organized and there are sections for each kind of food. One the outside is the fruit section, which includes a wonderful selection of fresh tropical fruits like pineapple, mango, durian, and snake fruit. On one side is full of Malaysian spices and herb like vegetables including one of my all time favorite things to eat on the planet - the stink bean. Stink bean, also known as petai or cluster beans, are everywhere throughout Chow Kit Market. They have a little gaseous aroma, but I absolutely love everything about them. In the middle of the market is the section for seafood and for meat. The lively seafood includes lots of different kinds of fish, squid and crab - fish probably being the most prevalent in the market. For meat there's mostly goat and beef - since Malaysia is predominantly Muslim, pork is mostly found in other Chinese markets but not much at Chow Kit. The lively display of all things food and the life that surrounds fresh local markets is the reason why I love visiting a wet market in any place I travel.

Surrounding Chow Kit market are a variety of different restaurants including some delicious nasi padang restaurants. The market is visited frequently by many people from Indonesia and Africa as well as locals to make the market a true melting pot of cultures and cuisines in Kuala Lumpur. Located just a few minutes by train from the downtown central area of town, Chow Kit Market is easily accessible and a great place to visit.

China has so many delicious street foods to try, and I've been eating and filming them for you for the past 4 years. After eating for 4 years, in my opinion, some of the best noodles in China are the hand pulled noodles found in Xi'an. China has some of the best street food in the world, and these hand-pulled noodles were INSANELY good, definitely some of the best noodles in China for sure!

If you're traveling in China to eat and try some different street foods, and if you want to learn a little more about Chinese cooking and Chinese food in the process, you should eat a few different variations of hand pulled noodles. When they are prepared for you on the street and you can watch the noodle pulling happening right in front of you, it's an amazing street food experience. You can watch as they pull the noodles thinner and thinner, and then scoop the spicy ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, spices, and beef into the bowl and boil the noodles. Then they place the steaming hot noodles over top! It is truly satisfying!

We're going DEEP to try some INSANE Chinese hand pulled noodles in Xi'an, China. Xi'an is home to the hui chinese, a Muslim minority in China that has some incredibly delicious cuisine. In the back streets of Xi'an it feels like islamic China, with so many different variations of Halal street food to try, including incredibly delicious hand-pulled noodles, loaded with spicy beef and chili oil and tons of spices.

And when your hand-pulled noodles arrive to your table, it's very important to mix up all the chili oil and ingredients thoroughly. This makes sure that the spicy flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle evenly before you take a bite. It is the most satisfying thing in the world mixing up all the ingredients into your noodles before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying watching the noodles turn dark red slowly, from white into red and silky smooth.

Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family.
Even if you see the juice labels ‚Äúnot from concentrate‚Äù or ‚Äú100% pure‚Äù, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.
In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.
Despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms.
When consumed, trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and synthetic preservatives. And if it‚Äôs pink, purple, or red, it‚Äôs most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine, additives which can cause bad allergic reactions.
Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies, skin rashes, breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on. Even more, popcorn is extremely caloric.

SUMMARY
-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit, but most of their content is water, sugar, and artificial flavoring.
-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners.
-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains, which allows producers to mark their product as healthy, but they also contain unhealthy sugar.
-Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid, a process that significantly increases the oils‚Äô trans-fat content.
-Manufacturers load ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.
-Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils, when heated, become nothing more than trans-fats.
-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.
-Microwave popcorn‚Äôs almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.
-If candy doesn‚Äôt contain sugar, it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.
-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin, which makes your body store fat.

The Role of Religion in Caribbean History,/watch?v=f-pTkUnb3v4,History,"The Role of Religion in Caribbean History with Patrick Hylton - From Amerindian Shamanism to Rastafarianism
The islands and continental territories of the Caribbean showcase as wide a diversity of religious beliefs and practices as can be found in any other region of the world. Aspects of the religious practices of the Indigenous peoples continue to be practiced in Guyana, Belize, and among the Black Caribs of Dominica. Catholicism, introduced into the region with the coming of Columbus competes with a wide variety of Protestant sects to be the dominant form of Christian worship. The syncretic religions, Santeria, Voodoo, and Obeah continue to be significant cultural forces. In addition, migration patterns in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially of indentured workers from the Indian sub-continent saw the introduction into the region of mainstream Eastern religions of Islam and Hinduism. The process of syncretism itself has produced a variety of Christian-based indigenous Caribbean religions of which the most well known is Rastafarianism.
In his thoroughly documented work, The Role of Religion in Caribbean History, Patrick Hylton traces the dynamic interplay of these practices as they unfolded in the plantation economies of the New World incorporating and reflecting both the oppression logical to the dominant economic form as well as the resistance of those whose subjugation was essential to the functioning of the economy."

Som Tam (‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥) and Gai Yang (‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á) - The Ultimate Thai Food Combination,/watch?v=VzKo83u49tc,Food,"Som tam (green papaya salad) and gai yang (grilled chicken), is the ultimate comforting Thai food combination. For more delicious Thai food, click here - http://www.eatingthaifood.com/

There are all sorts of marvelous Thai dishes to sample when you're in Thailand, but one meal that never gets old and always tastes fantastic is som tam (‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥) and gai yang (‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á). In English this would translate to green papaya salad and grilled chicken. As you might already know, som tam is one of the most popularly eaten Thai dishes, originating from the Isaan province of Thailand. First the green papaya is shredded and then combined with tomatoes, dried shrimp, crabs, eggplant, garlic, chillies and then pounded up with fish sauce, lime juice, and palm sugar. The result is a salad that's fresh, crisp, and full of incredible flavor. When it comes to gai yang, there are many different methods of preparation and marinades. Most are quite simple and just marinated in a bit of sugar, soy sauce, fish sauce and garlic before hitting the grill. When the chicken is ready, it's sliced up into pieces, and served along with a chili tamarind sauce. Along with som tam (‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥) and gai yang (‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á), there's no better accompaniment than a basket full of sticky rice. The rice is eaten in small bite sized pieces, balled up into pieces and dipped into the dressing or dipping sauce from the salad or chicken.

All around Bangkok you'll find mobile Thai street food carts selling som tam (‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥) and gai yang (‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á), and the freshness can vary, though usually it's fine to eat. There are a few different types of som tam to order. Som tam Thai is the version that includes less fishiness, the dressing mostly just being tamarind water, fish sauce, lime juice, and palm sugar. If you order som tam boo pla raa, your salad will also include fermented fish sauce. It's a strong flavor, but you just might like it.

At this small roadside stand in the Punnawithi area of Bangkok, everyday at about 11 am they begin to fire up the grills and start roasting the chicken. It can be smelled from kilometers away as the chicken hisses and grills to perfection. It's a simple street food stall and all they offer is a variety of different som tam (‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥) salads and gai yang (‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á). It was an excellent meal!

When you're in Thailand be sure to enjoy the beautiful combination of som tam (‡∏™‡πâ‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≥) and gai yang (‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á).

I was super lucky to be able to spend Chinese New Year in Southern China, a 2 hour drive from Guangzhou, in a little village full of locals, eating an amazing feast of Chinese Food! The flavours were elegant and simple yet bold at the same time. Very refined!

I was invited to this village by a friend who was traveling back to her hometown for the Chinese New Year family reunion. When I arrived to the village, I was blown away at how traditional everything was and how the locals were so happy and kind hearted. I got to meet and chat with everyone in her family, and was shown around their home and told to make myself at home. This was a nice experience after spending time in Guangzhou eating Chinese Street Food.

I watched them cooking as they showed me how to make sweet and sour spare ribss and how to make chinese foods from southern china (Cantonese style cooking). They had an indoor kitchen and also were cooking outdoor using a massive wok! Watching them cooking and learning how to cook the way they do was an amazing experience.

The family took me in as their own, and even gave me a classic Chinese hongbao stuffed with cash!!! This was truly a experience that I will never forget! I feel so thankful!

My favourite thing was the sweet and sour spare ribs, and the boiled chicken dipped in the homemade sour and spicy chili  sauce! It was legendary!

Thai green mango with sweet shrimp paste (‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏°‡πà‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô),/watch?v=G0RDsFhBky8,Food,"It's easily more popular to eat sour green mangoes than sweet yellow mangoes in Thailand, and one of the most popular places to eat ""mamuang nam pla wan (‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏°‡πà‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô)"" is in Hua Hin at Ran Salee Kapi Boran (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏µ‡πà‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏õ‡∏¥‡πÇ‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ì).

You'll find Thai green mangoes with shrimp paste in Bangkok, but I've never tasted the quality as I did when we took a trip to the Hua Hin night market (you might remember that epic lobster, right? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQlWzIpZIFM It's in the same market). Ran Salee Kapi Boran (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏µ‡πà‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏õ‡∏¥‡πÇ‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ì) is basically just a glorified street food cart that's packed full of famous mamuang nam pla wan (‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏°‡πà‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô) and a huge assortment of different sweet shrimp paste concoctions to choose from.

The owner is extremely kind and she allowed me to sample nearly everything before actually purchasing anything. I guess she knows that once you sample, you just can't resist ordering some to go. The Thai mangoes are picked extremely green, so they are crisp and have some extreme sourness to them. And even though it might sound bizarre to dip a piece of sour mango into a fermented shrimp paste sauce, it's actually genius. The sour mango contrasts yet compliments the fishy sweet sauce to make a brilliant combination in your mouth. Of course, if you're not too fond of fishy things, you probably won't like mamuang nam pla wan (‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏°‡πà‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô), but you should still give it a shot. It's surprisingly delicious!

Each of the shrimp paste sauces tastes a bit different, some are more sweet, others more spicy, and others are less shrimpy. Anyway, at Ran Salee Kapi Boran (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏µ‡πà‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏õ‡∏¥‡πÇ‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ì) they have got their recipes down to a science, brewing up the batches of goodness in quantity and selling only from their street food cart in the night market of Hua Hin.

It might sound strange, but if you visit Hua Hin, sample the mamuang nam pla wan (‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏°‡πà‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô) from Ran Salee Kapi Boran (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏µ‡πà‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏õ‡∏¥‡πÇ‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ì).

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

We started our Indian street food tour in Kolkata by warming up with a nice Indian breakfast, right on the street corner. You can order samosas, potato curry chickpea sabzi, jalebi, and hot tea as well. All of these go so well in the morning and wake you up and get you ready to start your day.

After that amazing Indian street breakfast, we went to try perhaps the most beautiful and photogenic Indian street food lunch stall I've ever seen. It really was like walking up to CURRY HEAVEN! There were so many delicious curries to choose from, and there was a huge pot of CHICKEN biryani right on the street. The Chicken looked so tender and you could see the steam and all the juices were infused into the basmati rice. You could also smell the cardamom in the biryani!

After that life changing Indian curry meal, we made our way to try a bunch more delicious street foods. There were so many to choose from!

Here are the addresses for the street food locations we found while filming this Indian street food travel vlog in late 2017.

‚ÄúTwo gene variants have been found to be more common in gay men, adding to mounting evidence that sexual orientation is at least partly biologically determined.

‚ÄúDean Hamer finally feels vindicated. More than 20 years ago, in a study that triggered both scientific and cultural controversy, the molecular biologist offered the first direct evidence of a ‚Äúgay gene,‚Äù by identifying a stretch on the X chromosome likely associated with homosexuality.

‚ÄúNow, there are signs of a comeback. A recent survey of more than 900 global automotive executives by consulting firm KPMG found that 52 percent rated hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as a leading industry trend. Japan has announced plans to put 40,000 hydrogen vehicles on the road in the next five years, and South Korea 16,000. Germany wants to have 400 refuelling stations for hydrogen vehicles by 2025 and California has already opened 35.‚Äù

Fuel Cells
https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/fuel-cells
‚ÄúFuel cells work like batteries, but they do not run down or need recharging. They produce electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied. A fuel cell consists of two electrodes‚Äîa negative electrode (or anode) and a positive electrode (or cathode)‚Äîsandwiched around an electrolyte. A fuel, such as hydrogen, is fed to the anode, and air is fed to the cathode.‚Äù

St. Louis Drive In - Incredibly Good Plate Lunches in Honolulu!,/watch?v=LnCVq9te9FA,Food,"A plate lunch is the quintessential meal to eat in Hawaii. Get all the details here: http://migrationology.com/2014/03/st-louis-drive-in-honolulu/

Okay let's just go ahead and say it straight up, St. Louis Drive In, doesn't exactly have the most Hawaiian sounding name - but they get their name from being at the base of a mountain known as St. Louis Heights. Anyway, now that we got that out of the way, we can move on to the delicious food, plate lunches to be more specific, that they serve.

What is a plate lunch? You'll hear the name plate lunch frequently when you are in Hawaii, and basically what it is, is a meal on a plate or packed into a foam box that includes a couple of scoops of rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and whatever main dish you choose. Popular things to eat in a plate lunch include teriyaki chicken, teriyaki steak, fried mahi mahi fish, mochiko chicken, chicken katsu, and those are just a few. You will find restaurants serving plate lunches all over Hawaii and throughout Honolulu. The most famous plate lunch restaurant in Honolulu is known as Rainbow Drive In, but there's also L&L, which is a chain throughout Hawaii, and there are so many others.

As a tip from some of my relatives, on my most recent trip back to Honolulu, I went to eat at St. Louis Drive In, located in the Kaimuki area of Honolulu. As soon as you arrive to the small neighborhood restaurant, you can tell there's something special about it - it just has that classic old-skool feel to it. There's no indoor seating, so you look at the big menu, which is posted outside of the kitchen, and make your order. They have quite a few things on the menu, including all the normal plate lunches, and additionally they have some of their own unique specialties like beef stew, stroganoff, and some other Japanese and Western dishes cooked Hawaiian style.

If you go to St. Louis Drive In during a mealtime, you'll be in line with a lot of other people waiting for the delicious food. There are two things on the menu that I would really recommend, and I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, so these are just two things that I really enjoyed and I think you will too. Number one is the mixed seafood platter, a plate that comes with two scoops of rice, a side of fresh sashimi, some deep-fried mahi mahi fish, and finally to top things off, two deep-fried shrimp tempuras. The pile of seafood comes stacked on top of each other in a beautiful pyramid formation. The next thing I really loved at St. Louis Drive In is the grilled ahi tuna belly plate. They really have some high-quality tuna, and despite it being a real hole in the wall restaurant, they cook their fish perfectly. The tuna belly was absolutely succulent, full of those beautiful fish oils, and juicy beyond belief. Unlike other plate lunch restaurants in Hawaii, they don't include macaroni salad as one of the main dishes, but I think you can order it on the side if you really want it.

So even though this restaurant is kind of a fast food style Hawaii restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food, and I'm speaking especially for the fish since that's what I ate. Everything was cooked perfectly and it was truly a wonderful meal. If you're looking for a delicious plate lunch in Honolulu be sure to take a trip over to St. Louis Drive In.

We had lovely meals at the beach and managed to go swimming in the Sea. We also had our nails done, did some beach workouts and played cards. The weather was cloudy and over-cast due to the time of year, but warm. I imagine in peak summer this is a great beach destination!

"üá∫üá∏ Fast food, Fat profits: Obesity in America | Fault Lines",/watch?v=slwgXXVXM3I,Food,"Obesity in America has reached a crisis point. Two out of every three Americans are overweight, one out of every three is obese. One in three are expected to have diabetes by 2050.

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites.

How did the situation get so out of hand?

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins.

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools?

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

Medicine of the Future: New Microchip Technology Could Be Used to Track Smart Pills
http://www.caltech.edu/news/medicine-future-new-microchip-technology-could-be-used
‚ÄúResearchers at Caltech have developed a prototype miniature medical device that could ultimately be used in ""smart pills"" to diagnose and treat diseases. A key to the new technology‚Äîand what makes it unique among other microscale medical devices‚Äîis that its location can be precisely identified within the body, something that proved challenging before.‚Äù

All-terrain Microbot Moves By Tumbling Over Complex Topography
https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q1/all-terrain-microbot-moves
‚ÄúThe ‚Äúmicroscale magnetic tumbling robot,‚Äù or ŒºTUM (microTUM), is about 400 by 800 microns, or millionths of a meter, smaller than the head of a pin. A continuously rotating magnetic field propels the microbot in an end-over-end or sideways tumbling motion, which helps the microbot traverse uneven surfaces such as bumps and trenches, a difficult feat for other forms of motion.‚Äù

Why Swallowable Robots Could Be The Future Of Healthcare

‚ÄúAlmost any drug that a patient takes orally will have an effect across the body -- sometimes that effect is wanted, often it's not. If a microscale device could be used to make sure that the drug could be delivered to the problem area, and only that area, it could potentially drastically reduce unwanted side effects from pharmaceutical therapies.‚Äù

Can Money Buy Happiness?,/watch?v=JSIkdWxotKw,Science&Technology,"TWEET IT - http://clicktotweet.com/dAeY6

We often hear it, but how true is the phrase 'Money can't buy happiness'? Is there a correlation between the two, and if so, what can we learn from it? It turns out, if you think money and happiness are exclusive, you simply aren't spending it right.

Mark Dwight: Micro-Manufacturing Entrepreneur,/watch?v=kpG8AVVUehM,manufacturing,"Mark Dwight steered San Francisco's iconic bike messenger bag maker Timbuk2 back from the brink of bankruptcy to profitability, and a $20 million sale to private equity investors in 2005, before leaving to start his own company Rickshaw Bagworks. He's a passionate advocate for the ""maker movement"", who believes that micro-manufacturers, like his small cut-and-sew factory in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood, are the future of American manufacturing. He earned his MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1989, and says he's learned over the years that being an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley doesn't have to mean working in the tech industry.

Amazing Far West Chinese Food | Xinjiang Kebabs and Pumpkin Baozi,/watch?v=6_aimzc-Nkc,Food,"FOOD RANGER MERCH NOW AVAILABLE! http://bit.ly/FOODRANGER

In China's far western city of Urumqi (the capital of Xinjiang), the food becomes less Chinese and more Middle eastern. Here you find Muslim cuisine that shows just how diverse China really is.  I was super lucky to try the lamb kebabs cooked on the street on my way back to Chengdu from Turkey.
Please like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin

I had a quick layover on my way back home to Chengdu from Istanbul in Urumqi. There was only one thing to do, eat Xinjiang food and compare the Kebabs to the Turkish kebab that was still in my stomach from the night before.

The total cost was 50 RMB ($7.87) for 3 awesome dishes:

5 Huge lamb kebabs
4 huge steamed pumpkin baozi
and one massive rounang bun filled with juicy lamb and onion

All in all, the food here was super delicious, except for the lamb kebabs. Ironically, I came specifically to try them, but they ended up being the least delicious of the three. The rounang took the number one spot and was crowned the most delicious Xinjiang food I tried in my very very short stay in Urumqi.

CRAZY Flavors from Around the World,/watch?v=sTW8D46WMpQ,Food,"After school snacks. Midnight snacks. Watching your favorite show snacks. We all have our favorite junk food to turn to when we need some comfort or to satisfy a craving. Well, your favorite snack food items just got a little weirder. Here are some of the craziest flavors of your favorite things from around the world.

Subscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr

6. Vegetable Ice Cream
 White peach raspberry sounds like a flavor we could definitely get behind, but did you know that Haagen Dazs also put out vegetable flavored ice cream? In Japan, they put out two vegetable flavors: orange-carrot and cherry-tomato. Not like the cute little tomatoes you can buy at the grocery store, but a mix of tomato flavor and cherry flavor, which are technically both fruits, so Haagen Dazs gets a pass there. Eating vegetable flavored ice cream is probably the easiest way to eat healthy, when in reality, you‚Äôre just lying to yourself.


5. Mountain Dew Cheetos
Gaming and snacking just became a whole lot easier. What does a Mountain Dew cheeto taste like? Salt, lime, lemon, is there a flavoring powder for carbonation or will these just taste like acid? We don‚Äôt know, but we would love to find out. There‚Äôs no word yet as to whether or not there is a Cheeto flavored Mountain Dew, but what better way to keep cheeto dust off your keyboard or controller? So, for your next Overwatch tournament, you could get liters of Mountain Dew and bags of cheetos...or you could cut out the middleman and get a pallet of these.

4. Pringles
 Salty and crispy, Pringles are undeniably delicious. And for anyone who has opened a bag of chips, only to be faced with a disappointing crumbled pile of what once might have been chips, you can be thankful for the Pringles can. It minimizes chip breakage and apparently serves as a nice urn as well.

Yeah, now you know that the Pringle can inventor actually opted to be buried in a can of original flavored Pringles. But we think he‚Äôd be interested to know that there are tons of Pringle flavors out there to choose from. Including some really weird ones, like the soft-shell crab, seaweed, or grilled shrimp flavors on the shelves in Asia.


3. Limited Edition Oreos
 This photo of a new Oreo flavor went viral in 2015. It looks like a slice of SPAM sandwiched between the two chocolate cookies--maybe that‚Äôs oreo cream made from SPAM? That might be worse, actually, than if it were just a slice of raw SPAM. It doesn‚Äôt matter, the whole thing looked like a disaster. And had it been real, it would have been a disaster. Uncooked SPAM? It‚Äôs plain sacrilegious.

So, the SPAM oreos weren‚Äôt real--and neither were the ramen ones--but plenty of weird Oreo flavors are real. Watermelon flavored oreos came out in 2013, limeade in 2014, and candy corn Oreos in 2012. What‚Äôs wrong with a good, old-fashioned Oreo?


2. Kit Kats
 What was your favorite Halloween candy? You know, the one you‚Äôd always trade with your friends to get more of? Ours was 100% Kit Kats. It turns out that in Japan, Kit Kats are a big deal, too, as the name translates roughly into a wish for good luck. Our favorite Kit Kat is the classic, but Kit Kats are apparently the perfect vessel for some, uh, unique flavors. Some of the most popular include soy sauce, edamame, baked potato, and grilled corn just to name a few.

All right guys, if you haven‚Äôt already, go grab your favorite snack food and get ready for number one. Here‚Äôs our featured comment for today:

Thanks to Erin Gill and thanks to all of our viewers! We hope to keep making cool videos, so like and subscribe to get our newest content. And now, the moment we‚Äôve all been waiting for...


Horse Meat Ice Cream
 Did we get you with the spam oreos? Did you think they were real, just for a second? Maybe even a few of you hoped they were real. Well, what about this one? Raw horse meat ice cream? Funny joke, right. There‚Äôs no way.

There is a way. Featured in this photo is basashi, also sometimes called sakuraniku. It‚Äôs thinly sliced raw horse meat. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. Basashi Aisu is a real thing and it means raw horse meat ice cream. Now, this isn‚Äôt really a thing you can buy anywhere in Japan, it‚Äôs sold more as a novelty to tourists and crazy foodies, but it does exist and the consensus is...it‚Äôs not as awful as you‚Äôd think. Horsemeat, to American sensibilities, is a pretty big taboo. But elsewhere in the world, it‚Äôs readily available and pretty popular. But it‚Äôs the whole...meat and ice cream together part we‚Äôre really struggling with here."

The Art Within Music and Architecture - Anthony Poon,/watch?v=qXzixohFVMs,Art&Music,"I have told you a number of times why I started this podcast and how much I love these conversations. Following is one of my favorites for a number of reasons. I had the chance to sit with Anthony Poon, musician, artist, teacher, award-winning architect and IIDA interior designer. Poon received his Bachelor of Arts from Berkley and his Master of Architecture from Harvard.

So, we talk about architecture but we also discuss music and art, compare and contrast these disciplines and explore ways to incorporate new ideas into traditional applications using untraditional methods.

I loved this conversation and I hope you do too but before we get into this conversation with Anthony, I want to thank you for listening and invite you to join in the conversation, you can find us @ConvoByDesign on twitter and @ConvoXDesign with an ‚ÄòX‚Äù on Facebook and Instagram. You can also find videos from these conversations on our YouTube channel, again search Convo By Design and you will find over 120 videos from some of your favorite guests.

GIANT Thai Beef Noodles & Braised Goat at Wattana Panich (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏í‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏ä-‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠),/watch?v=NR74br4VTAk,Food,"Wattana Panich (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏í‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏ä-‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠) is one of the most famous restaurants for Thai beef noodles in Bangkok. More details here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/09/thai-beef-noodles-wattana-panich-ekkamai/

A few years ago I made a video about Thai beef noodles, at a little restaurant in the Udom Suk area of Bangkok. The beef noodles there were extremely good, but someone commented saying I needed to try the beef noodles on Ekkamai Soi 18. I put it on my list, but just didn‚Äôt have the time to go there for a long time. But finally, after a long wait, I finally made my way to the famous Wattana Panich (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏í‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏ä-‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠) restaurant to taste the beef noodles - and I was excited.

I was even more thrilled when we arrived, and I peered into the most beautiful cauldron of slow simmering beef, like a jacuzzi of meat, that greeted me as I entered. Their pan of slow bubbling beef was one of the most amazing food things I had seen in a very long time, and I could hardly wait to order a bowl of beef noodles (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏™‡πâ‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏•‡πá‡∏Å). But along with beef, Wattana Panich (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏í‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏ä-‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠) also is famous for their braised goat noodles - so any chance I get to order goat, I can‚Äôt resist.

The kuay teow neua (beef noodles) came out first, and I ordered the special size, meaning it was a little bigger, and with a little more beef than the normal bowl. For the noodles I ordered sen lek, the medium sized rice noodles, and my usual preferred choice when it comes to noodles. The noodles were swimming in that beautiful broth, and then covered in a good spoonful of the amazing tender cubes of beef, and finally garnished with a few sprigs of cilantro (coriander). I tasted the beef noodles first, and the broth was a beautiful concoction of beef braised with a hint of spices like star anise and cinnamon. The beef was so tender and had so much beefy flavor to it. I loved it plain, but it even got better when I added some extra chili flakes and a scoop of vinegar to sour things up. It was one of the best bowls of beef noodles (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏™‡πâ‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏•‡πá‡∏Å) I‚Äôve had in a long time in Bangkok.

And then the goat noodles (kuay teow pae sen lek ‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÅ‡∏û‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏™‡πâ‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏•‡πá‡∏Å) emerged from the kitchen, the goat is cooked behind the scenes, not visible in the front part of the kitchen. It came in a smaller bowl, but the chunks of goat on the top of the bowl were so huge, I could hardly even see the noodles at the bottom. The goat was braised similar to the beef, I think. It was in a similar blend of Chinese spices, but included even more Chinese herbal medicine spices like red goji berries and astragalus root. The broth was much thicker than the beef noodles, so it was more of a stew than a soup, and that was fine by me. The goat meat was unbelievably tender, so soft that it completely melted in my mouth and I barely had to chew. The broth was calm and soothing, and extremely meaty tasting.

If you love Thai beef noodles or goat noodles, when you‚Äôre in Bangkok, you need to make it a mission to visit Wattana Panich (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏í‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏ä-‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠). Both dishes were amazing and so meaty. I loved it.

Phone number: 02-391 7264, 02-392
Open hours: 10 am - 8:30 pm daily
How to get there: The restaurant is located in the Ekkamai area of Bangkok, on Ekkamai Soi 18. You can take the BTS Skytrain to Ekkamai, and from there, it‚Äôs easiest to jump in a taxi, bus, or motorbike to Soi 18. You could walk, but it‚Äôs a bit far, maybe 2 - 3 kilometers.
Prices: 80 - 100 THB for beef noodles, 200 THB for goat noodles

AMAZING CANADIAN FOOD | INSANELY HUGE Christmas Turkey DINNER FEAST and EGGS BREAKFAST in CANADA,/watch?v=2NpetP71B1o,Food,"Canadian Food FEAST! We had a HUGE North American FOOD Turkey Dinner Christmas FEAST for VLOGMAS!! While there is not much Canadian Street Food in Canada compared to all the stuff like Chinese Street Food and Indian Street Food, there is a TON of AMAZING Home Cooked Dishes just like this Christmas Turkey Dinner! We ate so much TASTY turkey covered in Gravy, it was amazing!!

Canada And North America has a lot of different food to try,  but the BEST thing to me is the amazing home cooked dinners you get during Christmas and Thanksgiving. They are so filling and heavy! Truly AMAZING!

Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war drama film set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.

The film received universal critical acclaim, winning several awards for film, cast, and crew, as well as earning significant returns at the box office. The film grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for 11 Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director, with four more awards going to the film. Saving Private Ryan was released on home video in May 1999, earning another $44 million from sales. In 2014, Saving Private Ryan was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."""

Chinese Type 56 AK-47 (Shooting and History),/watch?v=A6cqYLdIqmI,History,"Sold for $132,500.

One of the most common types of AK rifle in existence today is the Chinese Type 56 in its several variations, although very few of those rifles are in the United States in authentic full-auto form. This particular one was captured by a US soldier in the Vietnam War, who brought it back and registered it, making it a fully transferrable gun.

The Chinese received the technical package for the AK (and also the SKS, among other weapons) from the Soviet Union in the 1950s, as part of the USSR's policy of providing military and technical aid to other nations sympathetic to the Communist cause (although a rift would grow between the USSR and China later). China would manufacture tens of millions of AK rifles, both of this milled receiver type (the Type 3 style) and the later stamped AKM pattern. The standard fixed-stock rifles like this one were fitted with under-folding spike bayonets. Folding stocked types were also made, both underfolding (Type 56-1) and side folding (Type 56-2). These weapons have become extremely prolific, and can be found in virtually any significant international conflict zone to this day.

Michael Madzo - Collage Artist,/watch?v=bR0abMN3T0I,Art&Music,"Michael Madzo's artwork speaks for itself in luminous hues and vivid, often-times whimsical subjects. His trademark technique of sewing bits of his paintings together attracts attention both for its symbolism and for the rich texture it adds to the works. Madzo's artwork is a synthesis of both traditional and textile art. ""It just...happened one day, ""he says thoughtfully, ""I needed to join two sections together, and had tried everything else. So I thought I'd try sewing."" Collage was the result. In assimilating materials at hand, the artist created something new."

"Connecting Geometric Form of Art, Architecture, and Music",/watch?v=AV6IQ55GZ_0,Art&Music,"This research investigates the history of various art forms of religious structures from both Muslim and Catholic Empires of the Iberian Peninsula throughout the end of the Middle Ages in Spain. By investigating the fundamental geometric forms of both Islamic art and Gothic architecture, there is a connection between religious influence, visual creativity and architectural  structure that strengthens physical capacity to the human experience. Relating these two art forms to music theory provides an introduction to the progress of music sciences in the modern age; including Cymatics, a 20th century science of wave phenomenon that demonstrates various geometric shapes of frequencies and musical pitch. This interdisciplinary approach of visualizing the common geometric forms of art, architecture, and music questions the anticipatory influence and outlook of the arts for future generations."

http://io9.gizmodo.com/5696469/the-crazy-life-and-crazier-death-of-tycho-brahe-historys-strangest-astronomer
""Science has many colorful figures, but nobody quite like Tycho Brahe. Beyond his astronomy genius, he lost his nose in a math-fueled duel, possibly inspired Shakespeare to write Hamlet, and maybe made his even greater successor Johannes Kepler a murderer.""

Tycho's Supernova Remnant
http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/multimedia/gallery/pia13119.html
""The red circle visible in the upper left part of the image is SN 1572, often called 'Tycho's Supernova.' This remnant of a star explosion is named after the astronomer Tycho Brahe, although he was not the only person to observe and record the supernova.""

Was Tycho Brahe Poisoned? According to New Evidence, Probably Not
http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/17/was-tycho-brahe-poisoned-according-to-new-evidence-probably-not/
""For 300 years, the death of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe death was the stuff of tragicomic legend. Seated at a Prague banquet table in 1601, he consumed copious amounts of alcohol and soon badly needed to visit the restroom.""

Transcript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?

Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud."

10 Things to do in Madrid, Spain Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Greetings from Madrid, Spain. Hello hello. And this is a city we visited 2.5 years ago in the summer. We're back with my parents this time and we're going to be here for just a few days making a little travel guide and we hope you guys will join along. This one is going to be a little bit different because last time we were in Madrid we ran around like crazy. We're going to take it easy focus on the highlights. Focus on food. Delicious Spanish food. We hope you guys will enjoy our little tour of Madrid.

The armoury turned out to be a real highlight with weapons and armour dating back from the 16th and 17th centuries.

We caught a glimpse at the Almudena Cathedral and continued towards the Sabatini Gardens, which are located directly behind the palace.

After lunch, we visited the Temple of Debod. This is ancient Egyptian temple that was given to Spain as a sign of gratitude for their help in saving the Abu Simbel temples. It dates back to the 2nd century BC and it‚Äôs one of the few works of ancient Egyptian architecture that can be seen outside of Egypt.

Plaza Mayor is the main square in Madrid. It is lined with shops and cafes under its porticoes. It was just a skip over to one of the most popular food markets with visitors.

Buen Retiro is a large park located at the edge of the city centre. It belonged to the Spanish Monarchy until the late 19th century, when it became a public park, and it‚Äôs home to various gardens, sculptures, monuments and small palaces

One of the most iconic buildings found within the park is the Crystal Palace, made of glass and iron, which is used for art exhibits throughout the year.

This cafe will make you feel like you‚Äôve been transported back to the late nineteenth century. The walls are covered in mirrors and wood panelling, the tables are of white marble, the chairs and banquettes are deep green in colour.

Last but not least, we finished off our visit with an evening stroll through Madrid, and that pretty much wraps our trip! The city clearly has much more to offer than we were able to cover in just 3 days, but we hope this Madrid travel guide gave you a few ideas of what you can do with a short break in the city. Wishing you happy travels and we‚Äôll see you in the next video as we continue our travels through Spain!

This is part of our Travel in Spain video series showcasing Spanish food, Spanish culture and Spanish cuisine.

""The water needs to be shaded because when sunlight mixes with the bromide and chlorine in Ivanhoe's water, the carcinogen bromate forms, said Pankaj Parekh, DWP's director for water quality compliance. Bromide is naturally present in groundwater and chlorine is used to kill bacteria, he said, but sunlight is the final ingredient in the potentially harmful mix.""

""Los Angeles has coated its reservoirs in millions of black plastic balls. But why are they a heat-absorbing black instead of light-reflecting white? Because they're shade balls, and their purpose has nothing to do with the drought.""

Wingmakers Music & Art,/watch?v=bxhPwMNZpgY,Art&Music,"There is something about this artwork and music  that touches one's soul. This particular piece (as with the others found at the Ancient Arrow site) is very busy, almost overwhelming to the eye.  I have tried to break it down for the eye and then put it back together again. The idea behind the paintings is that there is meaning in the symbols and there is communication that is going on at a deeper (subconscious?) level than we may readily perceive with our limited senses. The meaning of this piece is left up to the viewer and that is how it is and should be with all good art /music and myth I might add.  The work, for me, has spiritual meaning, yet if I was asked to tell you what exactly this piece is about, I could not. There is something sensual here to my ears and eyes, a multi-course feast (if you will) that the Creator (James?)  has brought together. This art and music is rumored to be from 'another universe.' It is modified (or somewhat diluted)  from the original because we don't have the same capabilities to perceive it display it and/or recreate it that the beings who created it have developed over eons. For instance, it is said that the pictures move or come alive when viewed in the individual chambers where they were found. Few have witnessed it . It is music and art that supposedly activates long dormant parts of our DNA, DNA that was intentionally genetically manipulated or altered by beings from other parts of the universe many thousands of years ago. Some on earth might have called them ""gods."" This is an ongoing, unfolding project designed by it's creators, the Lyricus teaching order, to open us up to dimensions we have here-to-fore not experienced. I am told we are now on the threshold of being ready for at least part of the information it can impart. The music and art here are from the Ancient Arrow site see: www.wingmakers.com also see www.Lyricus.org."

We moved to Okinawa, Japan for a year and a half together, explored as much as possible, vacationed Asia, and then we moved to Las Vegas, Nevada! We love to explore and have big dreams to travel the world full time. Kyle finished a 6-year enlistment in the Air Force in October 2018 and we dove into becoming full-time travelers. We are travel nomads now exploring the world. We love seeing new things and meeting new people and we hope you enjoy our YouTube channel as much as we do!

The History of North Sentinel Island - And Why it's Illegal to Visit,/watch?v=BmZ8Miogq54,History,"With the killing of US Missionary John Allen Chau on the 25th November 2018, a small island in the Indian Ocean called North Sentinel Island became a household name - and his Neolithic, violently isolationist, tribal Sentinelese killers the subject of amazement and mystery. Having lived on their island for around 60,000, they are the modern population group we know the least about, every attempt to land on North Sentinel Island ending in an attack mounted by armed tribesmen on the beach. In this video I'll look at the history of the island and look at how modern events unfolding there can be of anthropological use when looking at the past.

Inside the factory, engineers use modern robotic welding tools to manufacture the 212-foot-tall core stage structure, which will soon be assembled for the first integrated flight of SLS and Orion: Exploration Mission-1. SLS and Orion flight hardware as well as critical test articles have been built at Michoud.

Why We Love Seeing Other People Fail,/watch?v=i5pe4l3OFQw,Science&Technology,"Schadenfreude is enjoyment that‚Äôs derived from another person‚Äôs misfortune. It‚Äôs a complicated emotional response which feels good, but how much should it govern our decision making?

Stereotypes and Schadenfreude: Affective and physiological markers of pleasure at outgroup misfortunes
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3887033/
‚ÄúPeople often fail to empathize with outgroup members, and sometimes even experience Schadenfreude‚Äîpleasure‚Äîin response to their misfortunes. One potent predictor of Schadenfreude is envy. According to the Stereotype Content Model, envy is elicited by groups whose stereotypes comprise status and competitiveness.‚Äù

When your gain is my pain and your pain is my gain: neural correlates of envy and schadenfreude.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19213918
‚ÄúWe are usually motivated to maintain a positive self-concept, and we feel discomfort when our self-concept is threatened by others who outperform ourselves in a self-relevant domain. Considering the role of dACC in conflict monitoring, the association between envy and dACC activation suggests that envy is a condition in which information recognized by social comparison conflicts with positive self-concept. Experiencing discomfort motivates us to reduce it.‚Äù


Comprehending envy.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17201570
‚ÄúThe authors reviewed the psychological research on envy. The authors examined definitional challenges associated with studying envy, such as the important distinction between envy proper (which contains hostile feelings) and benign envy (which is free of hostile feelings). The authors concluded that envy is reasonably defined as an unpleasant, often painful emotion characterized by feelings of inferiority, hostility, and resentment caused by an awareness of a desired attribute enjoyed by another person or group of persons.‚Äù

CrossTalk: Forced Regime Change,/watch?v=I91elBaR538,manufacturing,"Traditionally the foreign policy blob ‚Äì with the assistance of the
legacy media ‚Äì defined an immediate threat for a foreign military intervention or coup. Their aim has been to manufacture public support. Today it is different. With virtually no public debate Venezuela is the target of a forced regime change. The problem is forced regime change has a dreadful record.

CrossTalking with Michael O'Hanlon and Guillaume Long.

Correction: The comment ‚ÄòCandidate Trump deployed foreign wars & interventions‚Äô should read *DEPLORED

Sichuan Food in Chengdu is so spicy. The Chinese food here in Sichuan is different from the rest of the country. Here, the food in Chengdu is much spicier and uses a lot of Sichuan peppercorns as well. Join me as I sample 7 nice dishes at a communist restaurant in Chengdu!

Please like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin

This restaurant name is ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÈ£üÂ†Ç ""Renmin shitang"", which means People's cafeteria, and is all in old Chinese communist style interior. It's a true sight to see. The servers are all wearing old Chinese communism uniforms and the food was delicious to say the least!

New Zealand: The Ultimate Travel Guide by TourRadar 5/5,/watch?v=_eMAXOp2PvA,travel blog,"New Zealand: The Ultimate Travel Guide by TourRadar gives you all the info you need to explore this nation of Kiwis. Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
New Zealand has a lot to offer even the most particular traveller. From the lively neighbourhoods of Wellington to the breathtaking Fiordland of the South Island, there's an adventure tucked away in every corner of this impressive country. Consider living out your own Lord of the Rings adventure in Hobbiton, or hike past Mt. Doom in Tongariro National Park. Not thrilling enough? Then skydive over Auckland, go white water rafting down Kaituna River or take a leap of faith and bungee jump in Queenstown! When you're in New Zealand, nearly ever adventure is only a stone's throw away.

Make the most out of your visit to this remote island nation by assembling your bucket list with our travel guide. Booking a tour will ensure your trip is fun, flawless and stress-free:
http://www.tourradar.com/d/new-zealand

New Zealand boasts a temperate climate with plenty of sunshine and moderate rainfall. Because of the long coast line, you can expect mild temperatures for the most part. The average temperature decreases as you travel south; January and February are the warmest months with July being the coldest month of the year. Remember to pack your waterproof hiking boots, waterproof rain jacket, swimsuit, flip flops, thin gloves, hiking socks, sunglasses, and a camera with extra batteries.

New Zealand's currency is the New Zealand Dollar (NZ$). You should expect to be able to switch between cash and cards quite seamlessly, as all major credit cards can be used in New Zealand. Alcohol and restaurant meals can range from moderate to quite expensive so prepare yourself accordingly.

We'd like to thank New Zealand's incredible tourism board for allowing use of their travel footage: http://www.newzealand.com/

---About New Zealand---

New Zealand, exists on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean and is home to over 4.6 million people, and nearly 30 million sheep.

The country is divided into two portions: the North and South Islands separated by the Cook Strait. The North Island is home to many hot springs and geysers while the South Island is mountainous, forested and covered in glaciers. Over 75% of New Zealanders call the North Island home, and more than 15% of New Zealand's energy comes from renewable resources.

Children Of Abraham: Part One (Religious History Documentary) | Timeline,/watch?v=xvPamPGiMxw,History,"Check out our new website for more incredible history documentaries: HD and ad-free. http://bit.ly/2O6zUsK

In the post 9/11 world, entrenched religious belief is often seen as a key factor in a ""clash of civilisations"" - Christians, Muslims and Jews locked into an age-old struggle.

In this thought-provoking three-part series, Mark Dowd, a Catholic who trained to be a Dominican Friar, embarks on a very personal journey to the Holy Land, Egypt, Turkey, Bosnia and the USA to explore the shared roots and deep enmities of the three faiths, and to discover if there is hope in a shared future. The prophet Abraham is central to the three great monotheistic faiths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Yet, despite these shared origins, and the reconciliatory promise to Abraham that ""all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed by you"", his descendants have often resembled a squabbling, dysfunctional family. Dowd's journey of discovery is an attempt to grapple with the big questions: Why, if there is one God, are there three so-called monotheistic faiths? Why do some people abuse religion to demonise their enemies while others build bridges to them? And why have the ""children of Abraham"" often fallen so short of the legacy of unity that was promised to the prophet?

Smriti Irani Hits Back At Rahul Gandhi Accused PM Narendra Modi Of Lying On Amethi Ordnance Factory,/watch?v=ttlA9Ho8j0s,manufacturing,"Rahul Gandhi on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of speaking ""a lie"" about inaugurating an ordnance unit in the Congress president's parliamentary constituency Amethi, claiming he had himself laid the foundation stone of the factory in 2010. His remark drew immediate reaction from Union minister Smriti Irani, who said Gandhi is ""scared"" and could not see that the new facility in Korwa area of Amethi was a joint venture between India and Russia which will manufacture AK-203 rifles for armed forces.

Women Enlightened Masters: Religion and History have Failed Women.,/watch?v=fsB2gqnYiX8,History,"Free Teachings: http://acharyashreeyogeesh.com
Facebook: http://fb.com/acharyashreeyogeesh
Spiritual Retreats & Classes: https://siddhayatan.org

Living Enlightened Master, Acharya Shree Yogeesh, condemns the mistakes of history and men for not recognizing women.

For centuries, society has been dominated by the male, and thus not recognizing women as priests, prophets, and even as spiritual masters.

Acharya Shree puts an end to this ideology and says that women have more potential to grow than men, because of the energy in the female body, if they focus and put efforts into their spiritual path.

He encourages women to find guidance to help them grow spiritually, as they have a lot of potential to reach the higher states of consciousness.

Further, he indicates that the idea of a male-dominated society needs to end.

= About Acharya Shree Yogeesh =
Acharya Shree Yogeesh is a living enlightened master of this era and founder of the Siddhayatan Tirth and Spiritual Retreat, a unique 200+ acre spiritual pilgrimage site and meditation park in North America providing the perfect atmosphere for spiritual learning, community, and soul awakening to help truth seekers advance spiritually. Acharya Shree Yogeesh is also the founder of the Yogeesh Ashram near Los Angeles, California, Yogeesh Ashram International in New Delhi, India, and the Acharya Yogeesh Primary & Higher Secondary School in Haryana, India.

In Search Of History - China's Boxer Rebellion (History Channel Documentary),/watch?v=U_QXW1VMPQ0,History,"Narrated by David Ackroyd

The Boxer Rebellion, Boxer Uprising or Yihetuan Movement was an anti-foreign, anti-colonial and anti-Christian uprising that took place in China between 1899 and 1901, toward the end of the Qing dynasty. They were motivated by proto-nationalist sentiments and by opposition to Western colonialism and the Christian missionary activity that was associated with it.

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' meaning 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he known as Ivan 'the Terrible' in English? Because he was evil or useless or because of anti-Russian bias? No, because 'Terrible' in English also means awesome or formidable - this was well understood when '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' was first translated into English centuries ago, but now fewer people understand this. (see definitions 3 & 4 here: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/terr...). The name stuck, and Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

It can and should be used for good.

What Can Happen to the Human Heart After Months of Swimming? | The Swim,/watch?v=ZLnxzZuhb9Y,Science&Technology,"Using ultrasound and a prototype waterproof monitor, medics and researchers are watching Ben Lecomte's heart closely. Can the way we examine his EKG waves in ocean waves help us prevent fatal heart disease?

*Note: at 3:30 when the video depicts the ECG signal, the intervals would not be measured diagonally as depicted conceptually, but with straight lines. Learn more at https://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/vlab/cardio/introECG.htm

How Advances in Wearable Cardiac Monitors Improve the Patient and Clinician Experience
https://www.dicardiology.com/article/how-advances-wearable-cardiac-monitors-improve-patient-and-clinician-experience
""The newest devices are small, lightweight, water-resistant, disposable, and can be worn for up to seven days. This extended time period allows for efficient diagnosis of a variety of irregular heart rhythms, including the most common form ‚Äî atrial fibrillation (AF).""

Artificial intelligence could help diagnose a deadly heart condition
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/10/alivecor-and-mayo-clinic-use-a-i-to-diagnose-long-qt-syndrome.html
""AliveCor built a deep neural network using EKG results from more than 1,000 patients with congenital LQTS and more than 1,000 patients without it. The system identified relevant features and continued to learn from the data. It detected the condition in people where the length of electrical waves measured in an EKG were indistinguishable from normal ones ‚Äî picking up on signals doctors hadn't seen. This could help diagnose people earlier and prevent sudden deaths, Ackerman said.""

Can cold water swimming treat depression?
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45487187
""This is called ""cross-adaptation"", where one form of stress adapts the body for another. There is increasing evidence linking depression and anxiety with the inflammation that accompanies a chronic stress response to the physical and psychological problems of modern life. Through cross-adaptation, cold water swimming may be able to reduce this chronic stress response together with the inflammation and mental health problems that affect so many of us.""

"Nasi Lemak - Fatty Rice, Heavenly Toppings",/watch?v=4sNJXlYxq0Q,Food,"Visit my site http://migrationology.com/ for more delicious food! Click the ""link"" above!

Nasi lemak is more than just the national food of Malaysia, it's a home comforting dish that the entire country is passionate about eating. Love for nasi lemak is nothing short of extreme affection, a purely delicious bonding form of cuisine.

But what is nasi lemak? In Malays, it translates exactly to ""fatty rice,"" but in reality the rice is steamed along with coconut milk and pandan leaves so it becomes fragrant and slightly creamy. It's not ordinary rice, it's pumped with extra flavor. Grains of the rice shouldn't be clumpy, but rather loose, not overly wet, but just perfect.

After rice is piled onto a plate, a choice of different other heavenly toppings are added to the top and the plate of nasi lemak is ready to be enjoyed.

Kuala Lumpur has a lot of food to chose from, and one of the best street restaurants in town is known as RA Nasi Lemak - a home style restaurant that caters to a local crowd searching for comforting cuisine.

I showed up at about 9 am to get a taste, and there were a few people in line and many people were eating at the tables provided. Unlike other nasi lemak restaurants where the vendors serves you, at RA you are free to top your fatty rice with whatever you choose using self service.

I scooped on some fried morning glory vegetables, some sambal sotong (squid in chili sauce), ikan bilis (peanuts mixed with anchovies), lots of sambal chili sauce and a big chunk of pure heaven chicken rendang (chicken curried in coconut milk).

I've had a lot of good Malaysian food meals in my life, but I'm telling you that this plate of nasi lemak was easily one of the most satisfying meals I've ever consumed in my entire life.

The chicken rendan was cooked to perfect, stewed in coconut milk and pureed spices that coated each bite in magnificent flavor. The squid in chili was equally delicious, not too chewy and bursting with flavor. Also, the sambal chili sauce, was perfect. It was spicy, not sweet, and went so well with all the other dishes.

The combination of the rice and the toppings elevated my mouth into new highs of culinary satisfaction.

Next time you're in Kuala Lumpur, be sure to check out RA Nasi Lemak.

Lyrics
Hey hey we are the UK
that‚Äôs an abbreviation for our name
The United Kingdom
It‚Äôs the same

This song is about the
UK‚Äôs countries and capitals
And 1 Province
Now let the knowledge flow

I am England
A UK country
I have a capital
named London
in the east is where I be

Shakespeare and the Beatles
were born in me
They were all great Icons
 in our worlds History

My capital is
Home the Tower of London
and to Parliament which is attached
to the clock tower Big Ben

I‚Äôm Northern Ireland
a province of the UK
My capital‚Äôs named Belfast
touching the Belfast Bay

I was created on May 3rd
in 1921
When Ireland was partitioned
by the British Parliament

Rory McIlroy, Joey Dunlop and
Van Morrison
Where just a few of the talents from
my province


Hey hey we are the UK
that‚Äôs an abbreviation for our name
The United Kingdom
It‚Äôs the same

This song is about the
UK‚Äôs countries and capitals
And 1 Province
Now let the knowledge flow

I‚Äôm Scotland
My capital‚Äôs Edinburgh
A country covering the North 1/3 of the island Great Britain that I‚Äôm sure

I share a border with England
to the south
And I‚Äôm surrounded by the Atlantic, North Sea
and the Celtic Sea down

Home to Edinburgh castle
and Wallace Monument
and the Pictish Stone
referred to as the Stone of the serpent

Hi there I‚Äôm Wales
My capital‚Äôs Cardiff
I am a country in the UK
and I‚Äôm glad you just learned this

I‚Äôm on the West of the Island
Great Britain
With 1680 miles of coastline
which is mostly mountains

Home to Caernarfon and
Dolwyddelan Castle
And my language is Welsh and English
and that is official

Hey hey we are the UK
that‚Äôs an abbreviation for our name
The United Kingdom
It‚Äôs the same

This song is about the
UK‚Äôs countries and capitals
And 1 Province
Now let the knowledge flow

Hey hey we are the UK
that‚Äôs an abbreviation for our name
The United Kingdom
It‚Äôs the same

This song is about the

In one day, we had 7 delicious street foods all made in the PUNJAB style. I didn‚Äôt realize until after we finished eating, but we didn‚Äôt eat any meat or chicken at all! It was true vegetarian HEAVEN!

We started out the day with an AMAZING Indian breakfast in two different Indian street food restaurants. The first was the famous Amritsar Kulcha. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can get this dish in Delhi, but here in Amritsar is the origin of this stuffed baked bread from HEAVEN. It‚Äôs stuffed with a spiced potato mix and onions. It‚Äôs sprinkled with a masala spice and then put DEEP into the Tandoori oven and baked. It‚Äôs served to you on a plate with Chole chickpea curry and onion chutney.

The next AMAZING Breakfast we had on our street food tour was the Poori and Chole with Potato sabzi. A little similar with the chole, but the potato sabzi was nice and sweet and tangy and very UNIQUE!

Afterwards, we took our TUK TUK around town for some more amazing street foods.  We enjoyed a street corner tofu curry served with a pancake and then we went to have a sweet and sour buttermilk lassi.

After this, we went to the LEGENDARY Kesar De Dhaba all vegetarian curry restaurant that uses PURE desi ghee. It was extremely flavourful and just a little spicy. We ordered the VEG thali and it was incredible! The paratha bread was so fluffy and covered in pure desi ghee, absolute HEAVEN! We also ate some dessert, a fruit kulfi ice cream!

After this we went for a couple more street foods in Amritsar. We were exploring the back lanes and found an amazing mango fruit stall! It was dried and covered in a slightly spicy and sour and tangy sauce. There were a lot of flavours in this Indian recipe. It was spicy, sour, tangy, sweet, peppery, acidic, pungent, and made your mouth pucker when you ate it! Very UNIQUE!

After this, we went for our final street food, an ICONIC street food in India, the samosa. It was stuffed with potato, cumin seeds, and spices.

The addresses for these street food restaurants in Amritsar, India, are listed below:

1) Breakfast Street Food Kulcha at Monu Kulcha Hut
Gali No, 10, Loharka Road, Ranjit Vihar, N.R.I. Colony, NRI Colony, Gumtala, Amritsar, Punjab 143001, India
2) Amazing Poori and Chole and desserts at Kanha Sweets
Shop 1, Opposite Bijli Pehalwan Mandir, Lawrence Road, White Avenue, Amritsar
3) Fairly OK veg curry DEEP in the back lanes of Amritsar (honestly can‚Äôt remember this address, go for the Kesar De Dhaba instead).

But if you look at a legit map of Africa, you'll see the same straight lines in the places that I marked them.

Street Food in Bangladesh -The ULTIMATE Old Dhaka Street Food Tour - Bengali Street Food HEAVEN!,/watch?v=DN5rJ_lKZJw,Food,"Street Food in Bangladesh is AMAZING! We found some of the BEST Bangladeshi Street food in  Old Dhaka! Join us as we take you for the ULTIMATE Bengali street food adventure through the DEEP back alleys of Old Dhaka! Today I'm (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), bringing you for some of the BEST Street Food in Bangladesh!

Bangladesh is a true street food heaven. We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people.

Everywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again.

The Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!

To start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.

After that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world!

After the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!

After this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country! I personally loved the faluda and found it to be one of my favourite desserts I've ever had!

After the lassi, we're taking you to try a famous Bangladeshi street food, the Pitha rice flour pancake loaded with spicy mustard bhorta. You can find these all over the streets of Old Dhaka and you should definitely try one!

After this, we're finishing off the night by going for the famous Murgh pulao found at nanna biryani. The best part of this dish was the sweet and rich onion gravy that covered the super tender chicken and pulao rice!

If you're thinking of traveling to Bangladesh to eat street food in Bangladesh, DO IT! The food is amazing, the people are friendly, and you will have a great time! I know we will be back for sure!

I really like this neutral color scheme and simple approach. The results are strikingly beautiful. I plan to do more pour paintings like this.

MASSIVE Seafood FEAST in Sri Lanka - INSANE Fish Market and HOME COOKED Sri Lankan FISH CURRY HEAVEN,/watch?v=fdQ60ZzsVR8,Food,"WOWWW!! We found INSANE Seafood in Sri Lanka! This MASSIVE Seafood Fish Market and home cooked FISH CURRY was HEAVEN! Sri Lanka has some AMAZING Seafood, and today, we're bringing YOU to the local fish market to pull in a HEAVY net of Sri Lankan seafood and bring it to our local friends home for a HUGE Home Cooked FEAST!

In Southern Sri Lanka, in Galle, we're bringing you to the local fish market and street food area to pull in a HUGE fishing net with the local fishermen. We're showing you how catching fish is done every day for the local fishermen and seafood vendors here in Galle, and also showing you the fish cutting!

Sri Lanka has some of the BEST Street Food in the world! Today, we're buying a MASSIVE fish from the fish market in Galle, Sri Lanka, and then bringing it to the fish cutting station to chop up into massive steak like chunks and bring to our local friends home to cook into a CREAMY and slightly SPICY fish CURRY! The fish curry  is prepared 2 ways, the first is the body and is in a mustardy and slightly sour and peppery broth, and the second way is a fish head curry that is quite creamy with home made coconut milk.

When we brought this fish from the fish market, many of the other SPICY and flavourful Sri Lankan home cooked curries were already prepared, so we watched the final preparation of these homemade Sri Lankan recipes in the traditional Sri Lankan kitchen. The pots were all made of clay and the fire was made with Sri Lankan Ceylon cinnamon!

There were quite a few fish in  the net  when we pulled it in at this local fish market in Galle. The famous fish are the pariah fish and the big ""malet"" fish as the locals called it. All of these fish can either be cooked up Sri Lankan style or also BBQ on one of the many  restaurants found on the street side in Galle.

This is the fifth street food video from Sri Lanka. We've filmed some amazing Sri Lankan seafood videos, like a Sri Lankan mud crab tour:

We've also brought you to one of the BEST Seafood Restaurants in Colombo and for a full on street food tour of Colombo:

Transcript:

You're joining me in a very special city. Let‚Äôs start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan‚Äôs capital, and home to the world‚Äôs largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you‚Äôll ever taste.

But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets.

This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I‚Äôve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.

So Tokyo, it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs busy and it‚Äôs brilliant. As ever, let‚Äôs start with the airports.

Flying from the UK you‚Äôll come into one of Tokyo‚Äôs two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.

So you‚Äôve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you‚Äôve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.

A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you‚Äôre being dropped off. There‚Äôs also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.

However the quickest option is the airport‚Äôs dedicated monorail. It‚Äôll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city.

The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That‚Äôs Haneda! Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Narita.

Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It‚Äôll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.

A word of warning about getting home; if you‚Äôre flight‚Äôs on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there‚Äôs a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport."

Old-School Thai Street Food at Ba Mee Jub Kang (‡∏ö‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏á),/watch?v=C-Ypi90JNDs,Food,"Ba Mee Jub Kang (‡∏ö‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏á) serves big portions of Thai egg noodles. Here's how you can eat here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/03/ba-mee-jub-kang-thai-egg-noodles/

Located on the outskirts of Bangkok Chinatown, Ba Mee Jub Kang (‡∏ö‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏á) is a well-known Street install that serves yellow egg noodles known in Thai as ba mee. The restaurant actually used to have no name, it was just the roadside vendor, who sold big portions of noodles to hungry passerby's, especially workers in the area - like construction workers and other laborers. So the name Ba Mee Jub Kang (‡∏ö‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏á) in Thai, actually means laborers noodles.

I'm going to be honest and say that it's not the cleanest street food stall in Bangkok, and nor do they serve the best tasting street food in Bangkok, but Ba Mee Jub Kang (‡∏ö‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏á) sure does have some serious old-skool character to it. As I mentioned, the restaurant is located just of Charoen Krung road in Bangkok, right in the busy area of Chinatown. As I filmed this video, they were doing construction on Charoen Krung, extending the MRT, so it can be a little trick to find the soi (so just make sure you check out the full article to see directions if you want to go there).

When you walk down the dark grungy lane, you'll see the restaurant on the right hand side. They still do most of their cooking with charcoal, so you can smell the smoke from the cooking. Around lunch time the vendors will begin to prepare bowls of yellow Thai egg noodles in big portions. They cook quite a mound at a time, pulling up and separating the noodles as they cook. The noodles are divvied out into individual bowls and then topped with a few pieces of slices pork and a handful of steamed veggies.

There are very few menu choices at Ba Mee Jub Kang (‡∏ö‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏á), and actually there's not even a menu, there are just a few choices written on the wall. The basic choice you have is yellow egg noodles with pork served either dry, or with soup. Ying and I got one of each, and they really are the same dish, just one with soup and one without. It's a matter of your personal preference.

The ba mee nam (‡∏ö‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥ egg noodles in soup) was pretty good, the noodles were nice and soft but not overcooked, and the pork was sweet and tender. The ba mee haeng (‡∏ö‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡πÅ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏á egg noodles dry) was also good, and seasoned up nicely with chili flakes and vinegar. Overall, they weren't the best Thai egg noodles I've ever had, but it's the serious street food atmosphere which made this place so interesting.

"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Tintagel Castle, King Arthur's seat of power",/watch?v=KUS88AGB0CA,travel blog,"There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility.

Tintagel castle is actually English Heritage, so I got my wires crossed and presumed it was NT because the OLD POST OFFICE is just down the road.  I think I may have gone to visit for free, oh well.

It was not really very accessible but the guys did their best to get my scooter down the hill to the bottom, at ¬£2 each way. You would need to be able to board a land rover, otherwise, the visit will be impossible.

The site of Tintagel Castle has been inhabited at least since the late Roman period, and a community flourished here in the 5th to 7th centuries. In the 12th century Tintagel gained literary fame when Geoffrey of Monmouth named it as the place where King Arthur was conceived. These Arthurian associations may have inspired Richard, Earl of Cornwall, to build a castle at Tintagel in the 1230s, and the enduring legend still ensures Tintagel‚Äôs international renown.

VLOG | Descubriendo Dubai en una semana,/watch?v=i_M5BzdWskw,travel blog,"Viaje a Dubai - Septiembre 2017

Primer vlog del canal y que mejor que estrenarnos con un viaje a Dubai.
Un viaje a la ciudad de los lujos y los r√©cord Guinness, una ciudad d√≥nde los retos son desafiados y todo lo imaginable es posible.

En nuestro viaje nos hemos hospedado en un hotel perfecto con vistas al skyline de Dubai, nos hemos perdido en busca de Jumeirah Beach, hemos cogido el metro y el bus, hemos observado la ciudad desde el edificio m√°s alto del mundo, hemos visitado el centro comercial m√°s grande del mundo el cual alberga un Aquarium de grandes dimensiones dentro, hemos visitado la ciudad de Abu Dhabi y la preciosa mezquita Sheikh Zayed. Nos hemos ba√±ado en el mar √≠ndico, hemos visitado el Hotel Atlantis y su famoso Aquarium Lost Chambers y hemos pasado un d√≠a de lujo en su parque acu√°tico Aquadventure Park. Tambi√©n hemos pisado el desierto Al Ain y hemos presenciado su rojizo atardecer y hemos montado a camello. Y c√≥mo no hemos cruzado el ri√≥ Creek en uno de sus tradicionales Abras y hemos visitado la parte menos conocida de Dubai junto a sus zocos.

Bangkok Street Food - Kuay Teow Kua Gai (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà),/watch?v=8tUhL3OijDY,Food,"Eating Bangkok street food, you'll discover a number of different fried noodle dishes (Pad Thai is probably the most famous), and kuay teow kua gai (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà) is one of my favorites. Get more details here: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/2014/04/kuay-teow-kua-gai-nai-hong-bangkok/

Kuay teow kua gai (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà) is a Thai fried noodle dish, that's one of the least common types available - it's not just available at any Bangkok Street food stall you stumble upon - you have to go to the right places - and I've had quite a few bad versions of the dish as well. Located around the Phlap Plha Chai area of Bangkok, just a short distance from Yaowarat Chinatown, is a little back alley, that's known very well by locals as the spot in Bangkok for kuay teow kua gai (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà). There are about five different restaurants to choose from, each serves the same dish, with their own unique style and taste.

Probably the most famous Bangkok street food stall serving this dish is a restaurant known as Kuay Teow Kua Gai Nai Hong (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Æ‡πâ‡∏á). This place is located in a serious back alley, and let me tell you, this is some proper street food dining in Bangkok. The cook sits in the middle of the alley, frying up noodles like the master, and tables are set up on both sides of the alley.

But what is kuay teow kua gai (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà)? It is a Thai fried noodle dish, made from fresh wide rice noodles, the same ones that are used for other Thai street food dishes like pad see ew and pad kee mao. The only other ingredients are chicken, pickled squid, an egg, and a light seasoning of salt and maybe some pepper - and that's really about all that goes into the dish. The reason it's so popular to eat and it tastes so incredibly delicious, is the way that it's made. At this awesome Bangkok street food stall, the chef used charcoal to heat up a wok that was full of oil. She basically waited until the oil was burning, and tossed in the chicken and noodles, and stir fried them in a puff of smoke. The result of cooking on high fire, gave the noodles and other ingredients its incredible char on the outside. The noodles were actually sticky, but at the same time they had the most beautiful crunch to them.

If you love to eat Thai style fried noodles, you're absolutely going to love kuay teow kua gai (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà). It has such an amazing smoky flavor, and the texture of the ingredients taste so well together. After I finished my first bowl, I decided I wouldn't be satisfied without having another bowl. But just before ordering a second bowl, I noticed on the menu that they had another dish, that was almost the same, except with no noodles and just extra egg. Again she used quite a generous portion of oil, heated it to extreme temperature, fried some chicken, and then poured an egg mixture into the pan. About a minute later, I had the most amazing Bangkok street omelet that I've had a very very long time.

Kuay Teow Kua Gai Nai Hong (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Æ‡πâ‡∏á) is a very local Bangkok style restaurant to eat an authentic version of kuay teow kua gai (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà). The food is a little on the salty and oily side, but wow is it extraordinarily tasty.

Vietnam: A Television History Part 1 Roots Of A War 1945-1953 (Unedited VHS version),/watch?v=wgohcX-Ip7E,History,"This is the original unedited version of the groundbreaking documentary Vietnam: A Television History.  The unedited version is very hard to find and I am happy to share it here.  This is a PBS series produced by WGBH-Boston.

This series covers much of the same ground as Ken Burns' new series.  I like this series better because we get to hear from the people who were actually involved in the war, as most of the key players were still alive when this series was produced in the early 80s."

We're going DEEP into a Vietnamese Street Food Market to find the best local ingredients and cook up a local home cooked Vietnamese food feast outside of Saigon, Vietnam!

In this Street Food home cooking adventure video, I (Trevor James, The Food Ranger) and Kyle Le + his cousin are going deep into a local market outside of Saigon to find the best ingredients on the street and cook up a home cooked vietnamese feast.

It was truly a delight to watch Kyle's family cook up some amazing vietnamese cuisine.

Asian street food is for sure some of the BEST street food in the world, and since we live in China, eating Chinese street food all the time, it's easy for us to travel overland or fly to Vietnam to eat the best street food when we like.

Here is the address to this local street food market outside of Saigon, Vietnam:

The street food market name is:

Cho Phuong and it's right next to the uy ban phuong thong nhat bien hoa.

Hello, haven't seen you in a while! Thanks for 200k subs by the way, this is amazing and more than I everrrr imagined when starting the channel.

So, six days ago I came home from a 6 day trip to Seoul (7, if you count the flight, which was 15 hours in total btw omg...). It was the best trip of MY ENTIRE LIFE, and trust me I've been to some cool places before.
I went there alone, so I travelled all by myself. It wasn't scary at all though. The people there and at all airports where super nice and every time I was lost, there was free Wifi somewhere around me, so I survived without problems.
One of the highlights was definitely making a Korean friend. When I was in Myeongdong he came up to me and after we talked for a while he asked me if I wanted to have lunch with him the next day. He lives in Seoul and knows all the good places which he was kind enough to show me.
Obviously I did more than just the things in the vlog, but I didn't film the entire time I was in Seoul. I think you will understand that sometimes it's very nice to put the camera or your phone away and just enjoy the moment. :)
I can't wait to come back (hopefully next summer) since there is a lot of stuff that I didn't have time to do in Seoul. Next time I also would like to visit Busan and Jeju island.

Hope you like this,
lots of love!!
